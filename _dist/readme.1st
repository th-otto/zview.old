This is a maintainance and unofficial release fixing some crashes when running
under FreeMiNT with memory protection. You don't need to install anything,
however if you want to make new plugins usable for other applications, copy
"codecs" directory into c:\gemsys\ldg (or any other location you use for LDG
modules).
