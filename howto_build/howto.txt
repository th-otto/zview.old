Building zView is a little bit complicated but not that much.

1. Download & compile & install libfreetype2 (the most recent version is
   2.4.6 in time of writing this, it's proven to work).
2. Download & compile & install windom 1.21.3 after applying the patch.
3. Rename libwindom.a -> libwindom1.a, same for the header file (windom.h ->
   windom1.h)
4. Checkout & compile & install ldg (from the official sf.net site). You
   must not use the latest stable version (2.33).
5. Edit the path to libfreetype2 in the toplevel Makefile.
6. make
