Here comes version 1.0 of zView. Even though there are only some 
small changes to zView's user interface since Zorro's BETA7, a lot of 
things have changed behind the scenes. First of all, MiKRO has made a 
great effort that everyone with some knowledge of GEM programming can 
compile and update zView.

Now, there is a support page and source code base on SourceForge for 
Zorro's tools for Atari/GEM, including the applications zView and 
zWeather. Zorro is the original author of zView and zWeather. He did 
all and everything that a lot of stuff had not to be re-invented. He 
made use of existing libraries and modularised his code in a way it 
can be taken over for other projects. MiKRO has followed this idea. 
He has opened the SourceForge website, adapted zView's code in all 
aspects to GCC, improved some stuff and fixed bugs in zView and the 
libraries (the same goes for zWeather).

As if this would not be enough, he has updated almost all libraries
used by zView and compiled a new version. Thanks to all his efforts,
zView is now a little bit faster and more stable. In addition, it has
a better file format support, for example, zView now supports the
latest PDF specification and can display still more TIFF variants.

At the end of the 2011, I got in contact with MiKRO because of
his BETA8 release of zView. As discovered later, changes in the code
of the plugins prevented zView from running under MagiC. He was so
kind and fixed the code even if it was not an easy task. Moreover, he
was open-minded to implement some small suggestions for zView. This
was so motivating for me that I have revised the whole documentation.
I had written the last version of the hypertext for BETA6. Now, all
features are documented. And the @{"glossary" LINK "Glossary"} is as
well up-to-date. If you want to know what @{"bit planes" LINK "Colour Depth"} are, or a
@{"palette-based" LINK "Colour Depth"} or a 32-bit @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} image is, read the entry Colour
Depth, and in case you would like to get information about the
standard picture format of our beloved Atari GEM computer family,
then have a look at the entry GEM (X)IMG.

Come on now, catch your digital camera, take some great photos and
view them with zView on your Atari TT, your CT60/63-accelerated
Falcon, your FireBee or any other fast Atari-compatible system.

The latest news: Zorro seems to be back. He is working on his very
promising Atari desktop zDesk. And as if this is not impressing
enough, he is planning zView 2!

                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                         Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                               Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can
apply it to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or
can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use
pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these
things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this
free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and
passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not
the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that
any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed
at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the
Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this
License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
    in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
    any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
    third parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
    provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
    under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is
    interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
    your work based on the Program is not required to print an
    announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
    interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as
a special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.


  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example,
if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended
to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by
the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided
by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
generally.

                             NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make
it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under
these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it
    does.>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
    published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
    the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA
    02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
    'show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome to
    redistribute it under certain conditions; type 'show c' for
    details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than 'show w' and
'show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the
program, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program 'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
  James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking
proprietary applications with the library.  If this is what you want
to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this
License.

@{U}1.4  Requirements                                                zView@{u}

zView is a GEM application. It should run in any screen resolution
and @{"colour depth" LINK "Colour Depth"}.

Nevertheless, zView has some requirements:

 ù You need at least an Atari system with a 68020 processor and an
   FPU (coprocessor). Note that you cannot use emulators which do not
   emulate an FPU, such as STEmulator, MagiCPC, MagiCMac or MagiCOSX.

 ù zView is designed for modern TOS-compatible operating systems.
   Therefore, you need TOS 4.04, MiNT 1.15.12, MagiC 5.03, or better.

 ù It requires a modern VDI for getting information about the device-
   dependent screen format. So you need a VDI with the EdDI standard.
   NVDI (from v2.5), NOVA-VDI, the VDI of MagiC, fVDI and MVDI
   support it. If you have got no modern VDI, you can use your VDI
   with VDI-Enhancer by the Behne brothers. You can find it in the
   folder 'Goodies' of this distribution.

 ù And it needs at least 4 MB RAM. This is enough for zView and to
   load some pictures. If you want to read PDF documents, you need at

 ù plenty of RAM (specially when using @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} pictures and PDF
   documents),

 ù a graphics card (we are still waiting for the SuperVidel for our
   beloved Falcon CT60/63 ;-) and

 ù a multitasking system (such as MagiC, or MiNT with N.AES/XaAES/

@{U}1.5  Installation                                                zView@{u}

Please install zView as follows:

 ù Depack the archive and copy the zView folder wherever you like.

 ù For correct rendering of PDF files with TrueType fonts, you must
   create a directory for temporary files, for example C:\Tmp\.

   Enabling the operating system to find the temporary folder, you
   have to set the environment variable TMPDIR or set, at least under
   MagiC and MiNT, a symbolic link on pseudo drive U to it:

     @{B}TOS@{b}

      You can use SENF by Thomas Binder to set the environment
      variable. You can find it in the folder 'Goodies' of this
      distribution. After installing SENF according to its
      documentation, you have to add the following line to SENF.inf:

@line 7 64 0 0 7
@line 7 0 3 0 7
@line 71 0 3 0 7
       ...
       TMPDIR=C:\TMP
       ...
@line 7 64 0 0 7

     @{B}MagiC@{b}

      Under MagiC, you do not need a program like SENF to set the
      environment variable. Just put the following line to your
      MagX.inf:

@line 7 64 0 0 7
@line 7 0 3 0 7
@line 71 0 3 0 7
       ...
       #_ENV TMP=C:\Tmp\
       ...
@line 7 64 0 0 7

      If you do not like making changes to a configuration file via
      an editor, you can make use of MagiC-Configurator by Philipp
      Donz‚ supplied with MagiC.

      In case you would like to set a symbolic link instead of an
      environment variable, install Link 2 U by Daniel Augsburger.
      Along with the manual, it can be found in the folder 'Goodies'
      of this distribution. You need the following line in Link2U.cnf:

@line 7 64 0 0 7
@line 7 0 3 0 7
@line 71 0 3 0 7
       ...
       sln C:\Tmp U:\tmp
       ...
@line 7 64 0 0 7

     @{B}MiNT@{b}

      Under MiNT, you can use the setenv command for environment
      variables and sln for symblic links; therefore, put one of the
      following lines to your MiNT.cnf:

@line 7 64 0 0 7
@line 7 0 3 0 7
@line 71 0 3 0 7
       ...
       setenv TMPDIR c:/tmp
       ...
@line 7 64 0 0 7

@line 7 64 0 0 7
@line 7 0 3 0 7
@line 71 0 3 0 7
       ...
       sln c:/tmp u:/tmp
       ...
@line 7 64 0 0 7

      Please note that MiNT.cnf has to be saved with Unix line
      endings. Best is to edit in qed since it automatically saves
      them for text files with such line endings.

   Of course, if your temporary folder has another name and/or is not
   in the root directory of drive C, you have to change the path to
   your temporary folder in the lines above. And in case of a case-
   sensitive file system (common for Unix-compatible file systems
   under MiNT), you must pay attention to upper- and lowercase
   letters in folder names.

 ù And if you have got no modern VDI (see Requirements), you must
   install VDI-Enhancer by the Behne brothers. It is in the folder
   'Goodies' of this distribution. Copy Enhancer.prg into your Auto
   folder. When you use SpeedoGDOS, Enhancer must be loaded after it
   @{"[2]" LINK "[2]"}.


Additional possibilities:

 ù If you do not have a CPU higher than 68030 but a DSP, you can use
   Brainstorm's JPEG DSP decoder for decoding @{"JPEGs" LINK "JPEG"}. For that, you
   have to copy JPEGD.prg, which can be found in the folder 'Goodies'
   of this distribution, into your Auto folder.

 ù If you use ARAnyM, JPEG pictures can be decoded natively with the
   host CPU by Patrice Mandin's NatFeat JPEG decoder. You just have
   to copy NFJPEG.prg, as well in the folder 'Goodies' of this
   distribution, into your Auto folder (before MiNT if present @{"[2]" LINK "[2]"}).

 ù If you want to access the help file after pressing <Help>, you
   have to copy zView.hyp into your Guides folder (providing ST-Guide
   or a compatible help system is installed).

 ù If you want that zView displays a @{"zView-compatible file" LINK "Supported File Formats"} by double-
   clicking on the corresponding icon of your desktop, you have to
   install zView in your desktop for the corresponding file
   extensions. For further details, see the manual of your desktop.

 ù Some applications use zView's @{"codecs" LINK "Codec"} (for example, zWeather, also
   by Zorro). So, if you want to make the @{"codecs" LINK "Codec"} available to those
   applications, you need to install them in a global folder.

   So do the following:

   Put the folder '@{"Codecs" LINK "Codec"}' in your global LDG directory. If you do
   not use the @{"LDG system" LINK "LDG System"}, put it in C:\GEMSys\LDG\ (default LDG
   path).

through drive directories to show their contents. In case of @{"zView-" LINK "Supported File Formats"}
@{"compatible pictures" LINK "Supported File Formats"}, these are displayed in a handy previewable

When a drive or folder contains folders, a right-facing triangle is
shown in front of the drive or folder icon. Clicking on it opens the
directory structure of that drive or folder below the drive or folder
name and changes the triangle to a downward-pointing triangle. A
click on the latter closes the drive or folder and hides its folders
again. But if you click on an icon of a drive or a folder, or on the
name of it, then the name of it is displayed in inverse video and the
content of the selected directory is shown in the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"} on
the right. With the first possibility, clicking on a right-facing
triangle, you can open the target folder directly, without having to
open and tediously redraw all the thumbnails in the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"}
beforehand.

In the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"}, icons and thumbnails can be selected by a
single mouse-click. A frame around an icon or a thumbnail shows the
selection. You can select more than one icon or thumbnail while
pressing <Shift>, but at the moment that can only be used if you want
to delete several files and/or folders.

If a file or folder has been selected, you can

 ù click on the file or folder name in order to change it (you can do
   this directly, no dialogue is needed!),

 ù delete the file or folder with the menu entry Edit/Delete or with
   the @{"delete file(s) button" LINK "Browser Window Toolbar" "delete file(s) button"} in the toolbar,

 ù obtain some information about the file or folder (for details, see

   format (see Saving and Converting Pictures).


Double-clicking on a folder icon will open the subdirectory of that
folder in the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"}. And a double-click on a thumbnail will
load and display the picture in its full size in a separate @{"picture" LINK "Picture Window"}
@{"window" LINK "Picture Window"}; in case of an animation file, it will show the animation in
this window; and if it is a PDF file, the PDF will be opened in the

There are some options to alter the icon/thumbnail display in the
@{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"}:

 ù You can alter the space that icons and thumbnails take up in the
   @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"}. By pressing the buttons with a magnifying glass in
   the @{"browser window toolbar" LINK "Browser Window Toolbar"}, you can display more or fewer icons
   and thumbnails. With the left button, you can increase the space
   and fewer icons and thumbnails can be shown per row and column in
   the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"}, but the thumbnails are larger. And, with the
   right one, you can reduce the space, more icons are shown and the
   thumbnails are smaller.

 ù The thumbnails display can be improved in @{"high-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} and @{"true-" LINK "Colour Depth"}
   @{"colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} display modes (16, 24 and 32 bits). In this case, you can
   use one of many computation methods to smooth thumbnails. You can
   select them in the @{"index card 'Browser'" LINK "Index Card 'Browser'"} of the @{"preferences" LINK "Preferences Dialogue"}
   @{"dialogue" LINK "Preferences Dialogue"}. But please note that the computation methods are very
   slow, so that you had better choose them only if you have a really
   fast computer.

 ù You can change the width/height ratio of the area that icons or
   thumbnails take up in the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"} to 4:3 or to 3:4 by
   selecting the menu entry View/4:3 Thumbnails or @{"View/3:4" LINK "View/3:4 Thumbnails"}
   @{"Thumbnails" LINK "View/3:4 Thumbnails"}. If such an entry has been selected, the thumbnails are
   scaled in such a way that they can be completely displayed in the
   area with the new aspect ratio.

   Select a width/height ratio of 4:3 if you look mainly at
   horizontal pictures and a ratio of 3:4 in case you use mainly
   vertical images.

 ù If you want that, besides folders, only @{"zView-compatible files" LINK "Supported File Formats"}
   appear in the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"}, deactivate 'Show unsupported files'
   in the @{"index card 'Browser'" LINK "Index Card 'Browser'"} of the @{"preferences dialogue" LINK "Preferences Dialogue"}.

 ù In case only @{"zView-compatible picture/animation files" LINK "Supported File Formats"} should be
   listed, that is to say, only thumbnails, set the check mark (tick)
   in front of the menu entry View/Show Only Images.

 ù Files and folders with the attribute hidden @{"[3]" LINK "[3]"} can be set with
   the file information box of your desktop (for example, with jinnee
   or Thing). If you want to show them in the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"}, activate

   format, such as JPEG or the GEM standard format @{"(X)IMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"}, an
   animation format, such as GIF (as well a picture format), or the
   document format PDF (see also Supported File Formats).

 ù @{B}Width@{b} and @{B}Height@{b}

   The width by height of a picture, animation or displayed PDF page
   in pixels.

 ù @{B}Planes@{b} and @{B}Colours@{b}

   @{"Colour depth" LINK "Colour Depth"} describes the maximum @{"number of colours" LINK "Colour Depth"} in a picture
   or animation. Please do not mix it up with the number of actually
   used colours. Either the colours can be given straight away (for
   example 256 colours) or in the form of the number of @{"bit planes" LINK "Colour Depth"},
   or @{"planes" LINK "Colour Depth"} for short. For example, 8 planes mean 2^8 = 256 colours
   and 24 @{"planes" LINK "Colour Depth"} mean 2^24 = 16,777,216 colours (@{"true colour" LINK "Colour Depth"}).

   Note that @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} images with 32 @{"planes" LINK "Colour Depth"} actually refers to 24 planes
   with the additional 8 @{"planes" LINK "Colour Depth"} either as empty padding space or to
   represent an @{"alpha channel" LINK "Alpha Channel"}, which is used for transparency data.

   For a far more detailed explanation, see Colour Depth in the

 ù @{B}Compression Method@{b}

   Many picture and animation formats can pack an image to reduce
   its file size. zView shows the used packing method here. Some
   methods are reversible so that the original data can be
   reconstructed, the so-called lossless compression methods, like
   RLE or LZW. While others accept some loss of data in order to
   achieve higher compression, called lossy compression methods, such
   as JPEG.

   Please note that zView does not show the compression methods of a
   PDF in the current version.

 ù @{B}Compression Ratio@{b}

   This is the ratio of the unpacked file size to the packed file
   size. The larger the ratio is, that is, the larger the first
   number is, the better is the compression.

 ù @{B}Decoding Time@{b}

   The time in seconds from opening to displaying the thumbnail in
   the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"} of the @{"browser window" LINK "Browser Window"}, or, if the @{"picture window" LINK "Picture Window"}
   or @{"PDF window" LINK "PDF Window"} is opened, from opening to displaying the picture,

   The size of the depacked file in bytes, kilobytes (KB) or
   megabytes (MB).

 ù @{B}Number of Pages/Frames@{b}

   Some picture formats can contain more than one image. They are
   called multi-page formats. For example, TIFF defines support for
   multiple images in a single file. Therefore, the number of
   pictures or pages are shown here. If the selected file is a PDF
   document, the number of pages are given. And in case of an

zView can save picture files and convert them into another format.
You can choose whether a picture should be saved in JPEG, TIFF or
GodPaint format.

Note that the first frame of an animation can also be saved as a
picture file and that, in the current version, you cannot convert a
page of a PDF document into an image file. Besides, please note that
Exif data (see also Index Card 'Exif') is lost when converting a file
with zView.

The saving and converting dialogue can be called by selecting the
entry 'Save as...' in the @{"Edit menu" LINK "The 'Edit' Menu"}. The entry is only available

 ù if a thumbnail is chosen (see Navigation and Selection), or

 ù if a @{"picture window" LINK "Picture Window"} is opened and it is the top window.


By the way, you can also call the saving and converting dialogue, if
available, with the save file button in the toolbars (see @{"Toolbar" LINK "Toolbar Icons"}
@{"Icons" LINK "Toolbar Icons"}).


@limage "images/savedlg.bmp" 0


Depending on which format has been chosen with the left popup button,
you can save a picture in the selected format by pressing the Save
button. A file selection dialogue with the old filename and the
extension, given by the selected format, in the input field will
appear. There, you can enter a new name under which the picture is to
be saved and choose the path if required.

If you want to convert an image file into the same picture format
(because, for example, you need a better compression for your JPEG
picture), you will have to change the filename, since the filename
including the extension will be identical and zView does not allow to
overwrite an original picture file with a converted file. zView does
not overwrite an original image because information can get lost. In
our example, the better compression of the image results in a loss,
because JPEG is a lossy compression method (also called JPEG), so
that the converted file contains an image with a worse quality.
Another reason for not overwriting an original file is that Exif data
could get lost since zView does not save this data.

Note that if you delete the entire name with <Esc> in the input field
of the file selection dialogue, you need not take care of the
extension because zView will append automatically the matching
characters; and if you use a wrong extension, zView will correct it.

When you have selected the JPEG or TIFF format, an option panel for
the corresponding format will appear by clicking on the Options
button. With these option panels you can configure the settings for
saving in the corresponding format.

@{U}2.7.1  JPEG Options Dialogue                                     zView@{u}

With the JPEG options dialogue, you can set the image quality wanted,
the greyscale and the progressive mode.


@limage "images/jpgpref.bmp" 0


 ù @{B}Quality@{b}

   JPEG pictures can have various degrees of compression. The lower
   the compression is, the better is the quality, but the larger the
   file becomes.

   You can set the quality level which ranges from 1 to 100. Values
   above 95 are generally not useful, though. A quality of 90
   produces excellent results, but in many cases it is possible to
   set the quality substantially lower without noticeably degrading
   the image. It is worth experimenting a little to help you make a
   choice in any particular case. This will depend both on the
   picture contents and on the purpose for which the picture is
   intended, including its scale of display or reproduction.

   Please note that a quality level of 100 does not mean a lossless
   compression. Regardless of adjustments you make, JPEG is always
   a lossy method of compression (for further information, see the
   @{"glossary" LINK "Glossary"} entry JPEG, section @{"JPEG Compression" LINK "JPEG" "JPEG Compression"}).

 ù @{B}Greyscale@{b}

   Using this mode, the picture will be saved as a greyscale image.
   Such an image file is much smaller than the normal @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"}
   version since it uses 256 different shades of grey instead of 16.7
   million colours.

 ù @{B}Progressive@{b}

   The mode 'Progressive' allows to save a picture in special way. A
   progressive JPEG will allow the user to get a good idea of what
   the image will look like before even half of the image is loaded
   and decoded. Unlike normal JPEG images, which are always displayed
   one line at a time from top to bottom, progressive @{"JPEGs" LINK "JPEG"} may
   produce, depending on which graphics viewer or web browser is
   being used, a 'venetian blind' effect or a blurry or blocky image
   that gradually sharpens. If a graphics viewer or browser does not
   support progressive @{"JPEGs" LINK "JPEG"}, it simply displays the image as a
   normal JPEG.

   Note that zView can save progressive @{"JPEGs" LINK "JPEG"}, but it displays them
   like normal ones.

With the TIFF options dialogue, you can choose the packing method.


@limage "images/tiffpref.bmp" 0


A major difference between most other image file formats and TIFF is
that TIFF allows a wide range of different compression schemes. Where
other file formats are often designed to suit a single compression
method, TIFF allows many schemes. Theoretically, you could even use
any compression method of your own, but, of course, this would result
in crippled portability.

zView supports the simple Macintosh RLE (also known as PackBits), the
once infamous LZW (because there was a need for a license from Unisys
to use this method), the lossy JPEG (the picture format is called
JPEG, too) or the free-as-a-bird Deflate compression (also known as
Zip).

Which compression scheme you select for saving space on the drive
depends on several factors. Here are some hints:

 ù If you want to compress a continuous-tone image, such as a
   photograph, and you do not care when the original cannot be
   reconstructed exactly, then choose JPEG compression (a lossy
   compression scheme). For setting the compression, or rather the
   quality, see JPEG Options Dialogue.

 ù If you need lossless data compression, use

   a) Macintosh RLE for a simple graphic image, such as an icon or
      line drawing, and

   b) LZW, or better Deflate, for a continuous-tone image.

 ù If you want many graphics programs to load your TIFF picture, use
   LZW, but the best choice might be not to use a compression at all.


By the way, zView saves TIFF pictures in @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} colour mode.

Zorro, the original author of zView, would like to thank the
following persons who have assisted him in this project:

 - Adam Klobukowski for the DEGAS format documentation.
 - Didier M‚quignon for the DSP code.
 - Dominique B‚r‚ziat and Arnaud Bercegeay for the WinDom library.
 - Patrice Mandin for his work on ARAnyM.
 - Sascha Uhlig for the documentation and the zView icon.
 - Cyril Lefebvre for the French translation (old versions).


And Sascha Uhlig, zView beta tester and author of this hypertext,
wants to say thank you to the following Atarians (this will be a long
list ;-):

 - Zorro (Belgium) for his Atari tools and applications, especially
   his wonderful zView, and releasing them under the free software
   license @{"GPL" LINK "General Public License (GPL)"}.
 - Miro Kropacek (also known as MiKRO, Slovakia) for maintaining
   zView, his great audio player mxPlay and other uncountable
   projects for the Atari platform as well as his indefatigable
   readiness to help.
 - Ekkehard Flessa (also known as Ektus, Germany) for checking the
   MagiC compatibility of zView BETA8.
 - Lars Schmidbauer (also known as Latz, Germany) for the beta test
   of zView BETA8 under TOS and MiNT and for his great home-made
   CT60/63 JTAG download cable.
 - The Unix/Linux and Atari open-source community. I would like to
   thank all of you. Without the various libraries, it would have
   taken much longer for Zorro and MiKRO, or even sometimes not
   possible, to support so many formats and so accurately.
 - The authors of many Wikipedia entries. These entries have been a
   great help writing this hypertext. Large parts of the @{"glossary" LINK "Glossary"} are
   based on them.
 - Rodolphe Czuba (France) for his great Falcon accelerators CT2 and
   CT60/63 as well as the CTPCI and for answering all my Falcon
   questions.
 - Didier M‚quignon (France) for his system software developments
   (CT60/63 software archive and TOS PCI driver package) and the
   media player Aniplayer.
 - Henrik and Torbj”rn Gild† (also known as the Nature brothers,
   Sweden) for the EtherNat (ethernet/USB extension card, and hoping
   that my board will be repaired this decade ;-) and the upcoming
   SuperVidel (a Videl-compatible graphics card) for our beloved
   Falcon CT60/63.
 - Patrice Mandin (also known as PmData, France) for porting the SDL
   library.
 - Pawel Goralski (also known as Saulot, Poland) for supporting the
   CTPCI/Radeon and porting GrafX2, a great bitmap paint program,
   specialised in 256-colour drawing, inspired by the Amiga programs
   Deluxe Paint and Brilliance.
 - Jean-Fran‡ois Lemaire (Belgium) for writing new GEM software,
   especially his fantastic clipboard manager GEMClip.
 - George Nakos (also known as GGN, Greek) for his widespread support
   of the Atari scene.
 - Roger Burrows (Anodyne Software, Canada) for still developing and
   selling the CD and DVD driver ExtenDOS and the CD Writer Suite.
 - Gerhard Stoll (Germany) for taking over the HypView development
   and for many other projects.
 - Keith Scroggins (USA) for permanently maintaining the Atari port
   of ScummVM (allows to run the famous LucasArts adventures such as
   Indiana Jones or Monkey Island).
 - Peter Persson (also known as PeP, Sweden) for his wonderful
   emulator ports (SMSPlus, x128, PeNES and so on) and developing
   system software for the SuperVidel.
 - Uwe Seimet (Germany) for his up-to-date hard disk driver HDDriver
   and releasing Outside and Diskus as freeware.
 - Anders Eriksson (also known as Evil, Sweden) for his great Atari
   website Dead Hackers Society.
 - Klaus Hedrich (also known as Klapauzius or Klaz, German) for
   patching Atari ST games to make them run on all kind of Atari
   machines and emulators (with compatibility to hard disks,
   multitasking operating systems, the popular Falcon accelerator
   CT60/63, screen enhancers and graphics cards!).
 - All Atarians I met at the German OFAM (Oberfr„nkisches Atari
   Meeting) 2012 and Christian Hellmuth (German) for organising this
   great party since many years.
 - William Wong (also known as WongCK, Republic of Singapore) for
   creating fascinating new GEM software, like PH News Feed, and
   making them compatible with MagiC and MagXNet.
 - The FireBee team for developing a new Atari computer.
 - And all other people who still support the Atari community.

There is a very useful GCC library to use zView's @{"codecs" LINK "Codec"}. The library
enables you to load, convert to screen format and zoom a picture with
only one line. To use this library, you need GCC 2.95 or better (a

@{U}B  FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)                              zView@{u}

This list of more or less frequently asked questions has been divided
into sections so that you can find answers to your questions more
easily.


Questions Related to the Installation of zView
@line 1 60 0 0 7

  zView does not work.

   This application is for high-end TOS computers. An Atari Falcon
   with an FPU or an Atari TT is the MINIMUM to use this software.
   Are you sure that your computer system follows the hardware and
   software requirements (see chapter Requirements)?


  Even though zView fulfils the hardware and software requirements,
   it does not work.

   Maybe your zView archive is corrupted. Please download it again.


  When I try to open the @{"browser window" LINK "Browser Window"}, zView complains with the
   alert 'zView can't load the icons' and exits.

   In your zView directory, there must be the folder 'Icons' with the
   icons in GodPaint format (icons for the @{"directory" LINK "Directory List"} and @{"contents" LINK "Contents List"}
   list of the @{"browser window" LINK "Browser Window"}, as well as the icons for the toolbars
   of the @{"browser" LINK "Browser Window"}, @{"picture" LINK "Picture Window"} and @{"PDF window" LINK "PDF Window"}; all small icons are
   combined to one file). For some reason, this folder is missing, or
   there is something wrong with the icon files. Another reason could
   be that the GodPaint plugin is missing in the folder '@{"Codecs" LINK "Codec"}' or
   doesn't work.


  Do I have to install the whole @{"LDG system" LINK "LDG System"}?

   No, this is not neccessary. Actually, the installation of the LDG
   system is almost useless for zView's LDG @{"codecs" LINK "Codec"} because they are
   not shareable at the moment. Shareable means that, for example,
   two programs use a @{"codec" LINK "Codec"}, but only one copy is in memory. Of
   course, other applications, such as zWeather, can use these @{"codecs" LINK "Codec"}
   if installed in a global folder (see chapter Installation), they
   are just not shareable. Later versions might support this feature.


  Why are JPEG images not decoded with the installed JPEG DSP
   decoder by Brainstorm if one has a Falcon with a CPU higher than
   68030?

   It was a great decision by Atari to support the Falcon's 68030
   with a DSP. The Atari Falcon was the only home computer with such
   a chip. Nevertheless, a CPU higher than 68030 is faster for
   decoding @{"JPEGs" LINK "JPEG"} than the DSP.


Questions Related to Images
@line 1 60 0 0 7

  zView crashes with some images. What can I do?

   Go to z-tools.sourceforge.net and write a bug report for zView.


  Some images are not shown with a thumbnail (and cannot be viewed
   in its full size).

   Although zView recognises an image by the file header instead of
   the filename's extension (so that it is really the format which is
   supported by zView), there are some pictures that cannot be
   displayed. Sometimes, it is almost impossible to support all
   variants and features of an image format. For example, TIFF is
   very complex. Another reason for not displaying a picture: it
   contains incorrect or incomplete image data.


  The colours of my 16-colour @{"GEM IMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"} picture are displayed
   inaccurately.

   Your picture lacks included colour information. The original
   @{"GEM IMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"} file format has a serious defect as a colour format since
   its specification made no allowance for colour @{"palettes" LINK "Colour Depth"}. If you do
   not use the same @{"colour palette" LINK "Colour Depth"} as while saving the image, the
   picture colours are wrong. There were several attempts to correct
   the omission of @{"palette" LINK "Colour Depth"} information, but the de facto standard is
   @{"XIMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"}, for eXtended @{"IMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"} format, defined in 1990. It stores the
   @{"colour palette" LINK "Colour Depth"} in the file header and is supported by zView as
   well as almost all not too old software that deals with @{"GEM IMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"}
   images.


  I have a @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} @{"GEM IMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"} image and it can be displayed, but
   its image content is distorted.

   It seems that your image is in PixArt TC @{"XIMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"} format. zView can
   only display GEM-View TC @{"XIMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"} pictures correctly. Unfortunately,
   there is no way of distinguishing between PixArt TC @{"XIMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"} and GEM-
   View TC @{"XIMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"} images.


  The Atari graphics application True Paint by HiSoft can save true-
   colour @{"IMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"} files; however, zView cannot read them.

   True Paint is the one of the rare examples that saves @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"}
   @{"IMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"} files in 16-bit instead of 24-bit @{"colour depth" LINK "Colour Depth"}, at least on
   the Falcon. Like zView, most other programs cannot read them.


  Altough zView supports JPEG-compressed TIFF pictures, they are not
   displayed.

   Your images probably use a very old JPEG-in-TIFF encapsulation.
   There were serious problems with TIFF 6.0's design for embedding
   JPEG-compressed data in TIFF (Section 22 of the TIFF 6.0
   specification of 3 June 1992). Therefore a different scheme
   described in TIFF Technical Note #2 was defined in 1995. The old
   JPEG encapsulation is now totally obsolete and deprecated for new
   applications and images.


Questions Related to PDF Files
@line 1 60 0 0 7

  Can zView display all kinds of PDF files?

   First of all, zView can display @{"PDFs" LINK "PDF"} up to the latest PDF
   specification 1.7. Like many other readers, though, zView cannot
   deal with video, sound, completable form fields, JavaScript and so
   on. You can open such a PDF, but the embedded video, for example,
   cannot be played.

  When I browse a PDF file, zView does not remember the last set
   zoom level for a page. Can this be changed?

   If the option 'Fit PDF to the window' in the @{"index card 'PDF'" LINK "Index Card 'PDF'"} of
   the @{"preferences dialogue" LINK "Preferences Dialogue"} is enabled, zView always fits the size of
   a new page to your window. You have to disbale this option.


Questions Related to the Development of zView
@line 1 60 0 0 7

  I would like to make some suggestions for zView.

   Zorro and MiKRO have made a great effort that everyone with some
   knowledge of GEM programming can compile and update zView. If you
   are no coder at all, you can go to z-tools.sourceforge.net and
   write feature requests for zView. There might be a programmer who
   like implementing your ideas. Or you can e-mail Zorro or MiKRO
   (see chapter Contact).

 - The options 'Show Non-Images' (menu entry) and 'Show common files'
   (option in the @{"index card 'Browser'" LINK "Index Card 'Browser'"} of the @{"preferences dialogue" LINK "Preferences Dialogue"})
   were renamed to 'Show only Images' and 'Show unsupported files',
   and they have a different meaning now. 'Show unsupported files'
   differentiates now between displaying all kind of files and only
   folders and @{"zView-compatible files" LINK "Supported File Formats"} in the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"} of the
   browser. And enabling 'Show only Images' results in displaying
   only thumbnails, that means just @{"zView-compatible picture" LINK "Supported File Formats"} and
   animation files.
 - PDF zoom level is remembered if the option 'Fit PDF to the window'
   is not set.
 - Updated documentation by Sascha Uhlig.
 - Revised RSC file by Sascha Uhlig.


Bug fixes

 - MagiC and TOS compatibility (BETA8 introduced one nasty bug in that
   matter).
 - Fixed a crash when user clicked on the info icon while the main
   window was in background.
 - Umlauts in PDF navigation list (bookmarks).
 - Fixed a bug in the GEM (X)IMG plugin.
 - A hidden memory bug, apparently without noticeable effects, but
   better have it fixed :-)
 - Long-standing bugs in DSP/NF JPEG decoder fixed (no crash with
   memory protection, JPEG export is not corrupted with DSP/NF
   decoder).
 - The option 'Show hidden files' in the @{"index card 'Browser'" LINK "Index Card 'Browser'"} of the
   @{"preferences dialogue" LINK "Preferences Dialogue"} also works with Unix hidden files (prefixed
   with a dot).
 - Scaling in full screen mode did not work properly (images that
   take up the whole screen had a colourful line on the right or
   lower side).
 - Corrected the dimensions of the progress bars.
 - Fixed a bug in the PNG plugin.
 - Shortcut <Control>+<U> also works with @{"PDF windows" LINK "PDF Window"}.
 - Fixed strange closing window behaviour.
 - In the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"} of the @{"browser window" LINK "Browser Window"}, the first line of icon
   frames does not touch the frame of the toolbar.
 - AV protocol also accepts filenames with apostrophes.


Known bugs

 - Umlauts in filenames in the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"} of the browser and in
   extended information of a file (Exif or metadata), displayed in
   the @{"information dialogue" LINK "Information Dialogue"}, are not shown correctly.
 - Background of some GIF animations is not redrawn correctly.

News

 - First release after 6 years. Zorro seems to have left the Atari
   platform. Recompilation of zView and all @{"codecs" LINK "Codec"} against the latest
   libraries with the latest GCC 4 (compiled for 68020-60 + FPU).
   Therefore, you get better compatibility, less crashes and a higher
   speed.
 - The Xpdf code was upgraded to version 3.03 (2011-aug-15). Thanks
   to it, the latest Adobe Portable Document Format specifications
   are supported now (PDF 1.6 and PDF 1.7).
 - Mem.ldg is no longer needed. It has no real meaning for zView.
 - The application is FireBee-ready. MiKRO did some test builds for
   the guys of the Atari ColdFire Project (@{"ACP" LINK "FireBee"}), and it did run!
 - NFJPEG.prg and JPEGD.prg updated (maybe it helps, maybe not :-)


Bug fixes

 - Fixed some bugs in LDG and WinDom libraries to make zView work
   under FreeMiNT with memory protection.


Known bugs

 - On ARAnyM, with the DSP cookie installed, some strange problems
   appear when saving a JPEG (and there is a crash with the memory
   protection).

There is now a special version of zView compatible with the MagiC
operating system (see folder 'MagiC'). This is a version compiled
with the old GCC 2.95.3 because it seems that MagiC cannot launch the
C++ application compiled with GCC 3.x.

 - PDF:
    Huge quality improvement in the PDF font rendering (Atari-
     specific).
    Zoom function added.
    Code upgraded to Xpdf 3.01pl1 (2005-dec-01).
 - Complete @{"Exif specification" LINK "Exif"} 2.1 support (and most from 2.2) for
   JPEG images (now, you can see various useful information, like the
   model of your camera, when the picture was taken, or if the flash
   of your camera was fired or not).
 - Now, zView can extract the thumbnails embedded inside JPEG images
   created with a digital camera. This means that the thumbnail
   creation is 20 times faster if the JPEG was created with a camera.
 - New options in the @{"preferences dialogue" LINK "Preferences Dialogue"} added:
    Skip Drive (preventing the CD-ROM drive, for example, being
     shown in the @{"directory list" LINK "Directory List"} speeds up opening the @{"browser" LINK "Browser Window"}
     @{"window" LINK "Browser Window"}).
    Smooth Thumbnails: now, you can smooth the thumbnails with
     various methods. This is very slow and only available in @{"true-" LINK "Colour Depth"}
     @{"colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} or near @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} display, but the results are perfect
     (specially with the Lanczos computation).
    PDF font antialiasing on/off.
    Fit the PDF to the window.
 - Utilisation of an embedded font to have the same look on any
   computer.
 - Animated interlaced @{"GIFs" LINK "GIF"} and @{"animated GIFs" LINK "GIF"} with transparency are
   now supported.
 - More zoom levels for the pictures (25, 50, 100, 150 and 200%;
   previously: 50, 100 and 200%).
 - More icons (function shortcuts) added to the toolbars.


Bug fixes

 - Many bug fixes in the PDF code (rotated PDF, problems with some
   fonts and so on).
 - Missing horizontal slider computation in the PDF and image window.
 - Little memory leak corrected in the multi-timer function.
 - A memory block was not freed in the file rename function.
 - Some redraw problems fixed (for example, PDF bookmarks).
 - Other little bug fixed.

News

 - For compatibility with the PDF code, zView is now under @{"GPL" LINK "General Public License (GPL)"}
   license.
 - Animation support added. The first format benefitting from that is
   GIF (space bar for pause/resume).
 - PDF read support (you will need a lot of memory to read a PDF).
 - Reservoir Gods' GodPaint read and write support.
 - Zoom available with the browser toolbar or <+> and <-> on the
   numerical keyboard.
 - Documentation and zView icon provided by Sascha Uhlig. Thanks to
   him!
 - French translation of the RSC by Cyril Lefebvre. Thanks to him!
 - Now, zView can save from an interlaced picture.
 - The scrolling in the @{"picture window" LINK "Picture Window"} and the redraw function are a
   little bit faster.
 - Custom font added for the @{"index card 'Exif'" LINK "Index Card 'Exif'"} of the @{"information" LINK "Information Dialogue"}
   @{"dialogue" LINK "Information Dialogue"} to see more lines.
 - VDI-Enhancer from the Behne brothers provided in the folder
   'Goodies'. Install it if you use the standard Atari VDI instead
   of, for example, NVDI or fVDI.
 - Other little changes, like <Control>+<U> (standard) to close the
   window instead of <Control>+<W>, menu bar deactivation when a
   picture is loaded, or 'Out of memory' warning in the full screen
   code.


Bug fixes

 - Unnecessary redraws of the menu bar when the window was being
   scrolled.
 - Double redraw of the @{"browser window" LINK "Browser Window"} when it was opened.
 - When you open a selected folder in the @{"contents list" LINK "Contents List"} and you go
   back again, the folder remains selected. The code was there, but
   it was wrong.
 - Static MFDB structures were fried in 'winimg' and the full screen
   code!
 - 1-@{"plane" LINK "Colour Depth"} pictures and icons were not correctly drawn in full screen
   mode and in the browser toolbar.
 - The progress bar was one pixel too wide and high.
 - Problem with 1-bit DEGAS pictures corrected.
 - Now, the background in full screen mode is always black.
 - In the GIF @{"codec" LINK "Codec"}, a crash occurred if textual information was
   greater than 255 lines.
 - Incorrect translation in the GUI (octets -> bytes, and so on).


Known bugs

 - On ARAnyM, with the DSP cookie installed, some strange problems
   appear when saving a JPEG.
 - Various @{"animated GIFs" LINK "GIF"} are badly rendered.
 - For some rare @{"PDFs" LINK "PDF"}, the fonts are outlined.
 - The decoding of @{"PDFs" LINK "PDF"} with big pictures inside is very slow (not
   really a bug, but this code must be rewritten).

News

 - Versions of the binaries and @{"codecs" LINK "Codec"} for 68020-60 systems, and
   68000 and 68020 systems without FPU available.
 - Full screen mode with automatic picture resize if the picture is
   bigger than the screen (shortcut <F10>).
 - Another cool feature: when a window is iconified, zView shows a
   thumbnail of the picture inside the iconified window.
 - With the latest ARAnyM from CVS, the JPEG pictures are decoded
   natively with the host CPU! (In order to use this feature, put
   NFJPEG.prg in your Auto folder before MiNT.) Many thanks to
   Patrice Mandin for his work on ARAnyM!
 - The DSP and the main JPEG @{"codec" LINK "Codec"} are merged in only one codec. If
   the Brainstorm cookie is detected and you do not have a 68060, the
   JPEG is decoded with the DSP, or else the CPU routine is used.
 - Support of DEGAS compressed added (PC1, PC2, PC3).
 - Other little changes, like recompilation of all @{"codecs" LINK "Codec"} with the
   latest GCC, the possibility to move the about box with XaAES or
   information about the license.


Bug fixes

 - Many problems with other operating systems than MiNT are
   corrected. For example, the plugins were not loaded if these were
   in the global folder (LDGPATH\@{"Codecs" LINK "Codec"}) under TOS and MagiC.
 - Problems with some DEGAS images fixed.
 - With the DSP, JPEG pictures no multiple of 16 were badly decoded.
 - In @{"planes" LINK "Colour Depth"} < 8 bits, the @{"toolbar icons" LINK "Toolbar Icons"} were not shown.
 - VDI EdDI check at the start.
 - zView saves the @{"browser window" LINK "Browser Window"} coordinates when you quit the
   application. Now, these coordinates are not saved if this window
   is iconified (in order to prevent bad @{"browser window" LINK "Browser Window"} coordinates
   on next relaunch).
 - Other little bug fixes, like problems with the menu bar handling
   or error messages not correct.

An @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} image uses three @{"channels" LINK "Colour Depth"}: one for red, green and
blue. Each @{"channel" LINK "Colour Depth"} has a size of 8 bits (256 variants). So a 24-bit
picture has 256 x 256 x 256 = 16,777,216 colours (for a far more
detailed explanation see Colour Depth). @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} images with 32 bits have
an additional @{"channel" LINK "Colour Depth"} which is called alpha channel. It is used to
determine the pixels' translucency levels. The more transparent a
pixel, the less it hides the background against which the image is
presented. The degree of pixel transparency for an 8-bit alpha value
ranges from 0 (the pixel is completely invisible or transparent) to
255 (the pixel is completely visible or opaque).

Note that the picture format PNG even supports alpha values for 1-,
2-, 4- and 8-bit colour and 8-bit greyscale pictures. For further
details, see PNG.

Old programs do not deal with the transparency layer. They treat only
the first three @{"channels" LINK "Colour Depth"} like standard 24-bit images. In contrast to
them, zView can use the alpha @{"channel" LINK "Colour Depth"} of pictures for displaying them.

ARAnyM is an acronym: Atari Running on Any Machine. It is a virtual
machine software designed and developed for running 32-bit Atari ST/
TT/Falcon operating systems (TOS, FreeMiNT, MagiC and others) and TOS/
GEM applications on any kind of hardware, be it a PC, an Apple, a
Unix server, a graphics workstation or even a portable computer.

ARAnyM is not meant as an emulator of the Atari Falcon (even though
it has a rather high Falcon software compatibility and includes most
of the Falcon custom chips, including Videl and DSP). Since ARAnyM is
is not tied to the specification of any existing Atari machine, the
most complete CPU (68040 with MMU) and FPU (68882) could be selected,
loads of RAM (up to 4 GB) added, host accelerated graphics (even with
OpenGL) and direct access to various host resources including sound,
disk drives, optical storage devices (CD/DVD-ROMs), parallel port and
more.

ARAnyM is not yet another TOS clone similar to Medusa, Hades or
Milan, but actually much cheaper (because it is free software) and
way more powerful (because the host hardware gets faster every day).
One of the goals, to create a distribution installable from a CD that
would turn any PC machine into full-featured Atari power machine, can
be tested with the ARAnyM/AFROS Live CD.

BMP is the standard picture format of Microsoft Windows [like @{"(X)IMG" LINK "GEM (X)IMG"}
for GEM] and is used as an internal format to store virtually any
type of bitmap data. BMP is also very popular in the MS-DOS operating
system. And IBM's OS/2 operating system (version 1.x and 2.x) uses
variants of the Windows Bitmap format as standard picture file format.


Usage
@line 1 60 0 0 7

The files are usually not compressed, so they are typically much
larger than compressed picture file formats for the same image.
Nevertheless, the simplicity of BMP and its widespread familiarity in
Windows and elsewhere, as well as the fact that this format is well
documented and free of patents, makes it a very common format that
image processing programs from many operating systems can read and
write.


Compression
@line 1 60 0 0 7

The Windows BMP format supports a byte-wise RLE compression scheme
for compressing 4-bit and 8-bit bitmap data. 1-, 16-, 24-, and 32-bit
bitmaps cannot be compressed using this kind of RLE scheme due to the
typical lack of long runs of bytes with identical values in these
types of data. Furthermore, RLE is unsuitable for complex images.


Bottom-Up Bitmaps
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Unlike other file formats, which store image data from top to bottom,
the BMP format can store image data from bottom to top. Almost all
BMP images are stored in this way, so-called bottom-up bitmaps. This
means that if memory is tight, these BMP graphics will sometimes
appear drawn from bottom to top.

Definition 1: Codec is short for compressor/decompressor. It is a
software, hardware or a combination of both that compresses and
decompresses audio and video data streams. The purpose of a codec is
to reduce the size of digital audio samples and video frames in order
to speed up transmission and save storage space. The goal of all
codec designers is to maintain audio and video quality while
compressing the binary data further. Lossy methods are widely used,
which actually discard bits that most people cannot hear or see. Some
popular codecs for computer video include MPEG, Indeo and Cinepak;
well-known audio codecs are MP3 and Ogg Vorbis.

Definition 2: Codec is short for either compressor/decompressor or
coder/decoder, which describes a software, hardware or a combination
of both, capable of performing transformations on a data stream or
signal. Codecs can both put the stream or signal into an encoded form
(often for transmission, storage or encryption) and retrieve, or
decode that form for viewing or manipulation in a format more
appropriate for these operations.

The second and more general definition reveals why zView's plugins
for reading and saving picture/animation formats are called codecs,
too: The plugins can decode these formats and decompress the picture/
animation data in order for viewing them. In addition, some plugins
are able to compress and encode picture data in order to save them in
the corresponding picture format.

By the way, zView's picture/animation codecs can be used as well by
other applications (see Note for Programmers).

@node "Colour Depth" "Glossary"

@{U}D  Colour Depth                                                  zView@{u}

Colour depth is the number of distinct colours available in the
current picture or screen resolution. Colour depth is often referred
to as bit depth, because it is directly related to the number of bits
used for each pixel. For example, a 24-bit colour (or 24-bit for
short) video adapter has a colour depth of 2 to the 24th power (about
16.7 million colours). One would say that its colour depth is 24 bits
per pixel (24 bpp). But instead of the unit bits per pixel (bpp), one
often uses the less accurate unit bits.

Sometimes colour depth is given in bit planes, or planes for short.
A bit plane can be explained as follows. An 1-bit colour resolution
is either black or white in display. The memory used to represent an
entire screen at 1-bit resolution is called a bit plane. Additional
colour is added to the display through the use of additional bit
planes. Luckily, the number of bits per pixel is identical to the
number of bit planes.

Colour depths can be divided into different types of colours or
colour modes: index colour and direct colour.

 ù @{B}Indexed Colour@{b}

   Indexed colour means that the colour of each pixel is represented
   by an index number, and each number corresponds to a colour in a
   table or palette (note that all pixels with the same colour have
   the same index number). This palette is then used to map colour to
   pixels. In the case of images, the palette is attached to the
   picture.

   Indexed colour is used when colours do not exceed 256 colours. For
   more colours, the palette becomes too large, and a direct-colour
   method is preferred.

   Common colour depths with indexed colour:
    - 1-bit colour (2^1 = 2 colours; monochrome, often black and
      white),
    - 2-bit colour (2^2 = 4 colours),
    - 4-bit colour (2^4 = 16 colours) and
    - 8-bit colour (2^8 = 256 colours).


 ù @{B}Direct Colour@{b}

   In higher colour depths, the colour value typically DIRECTLY
   encodes relative brightnesses of a primary colour to specify a
   colour in a special colour model. In other words, pixels of non-
   indexed images or screen resolutions store actual colour values
   instead of index numbers. Each pixel consists of components, also
   known as channels. Greyscale formats have only one channel. RGB
   formats have three channels: red, green and blue. CMYK formats
   have four channels: cyan, magenta, yellow and black (K = black
   because B is already used for blue).

   a) 5(6) Bits Per Channel RGB (High Colour)

      15- and 16-bit colour depths are called high colour. They are
      considered sufficient to provide life-like colours:

      15-bit colour uses 5 bits to represent red, 5 bits to represent
      blue and 5 bits to represent green. 2^5 = 32 levels of each of
      these three colour can therefore be combined to give a total of
      32,768 mixed colours (32 x 32 x 32 = 32,768).

      16-bit colour uses 5 bits to represent red, 5 bits to represent
      blue, but uses, since the human eye is more sensitive to the
      colour, 6 bits to represent 64 levels of green. These can
      therefore be combined to give 65,536 mixed colours (32 x 32 x
      64 = 65,536).

   b) 8 Bits Per Channel (8-/16-bit Greyscale, True Colour)

      There are the following kinds of greyscale, RGB and CYMK 8-bit
      per channel pixel formats:
       - 8-bit greyscale,
       - 24-bit RGB,
       - 32-bit CMYK,
       - 16-bit greyscale + alpha,
       - 32-bit RGBA (RGB + alpha) and
       - 32-bit RGB (without alpha, extra byte is not used).

      24- and 32-bit colour formats are known as true colour. Each
      pixel is defined in terms of its actual RGB or CMYK values.
      Every pixel in a true-colour format has 2^8 = 256 possible
      values for each of its red, green or blue components (in the
      RGB model) or cyan, magenta, yellow and black (in the CMYK
      model). Since there are 256 possible values for each RGB or
      CMYK component, then RGB true colour would have a 24-bit colour
      depth and CMYK true colour would have a 32-bit colour depth.
      These colour depths allow to represent as much colour hues as
      human eye can recognise. That is why they are called true
      colour.

      Even though there are more bits per pixel in the CMYK model, it
      has, in reality, not more colours than RGB (256 x 256 x 256 =
      16,777,216 colours) because the black component is only extra
      since a mix of 100% each of cyan, magenta and yellow already
      produces black. The black component is added because the CMYK
      model is used for printing. Due to difficulties to produce
      pigments that will produce black, a separate black ink is often
      used.

      16- and 32-bit pixel formats (16-bit greyscale + alpha or 32-
      bit RGBA) can contain an extra component called @{"alpha channel" LINK "Alpha Channel"}.
      It does not contain any colour information, it specifies the
      degree of pixel opacity when it is overlayed on another image.
      The less alpha value is, the more transparent is the pixel.

      You can see now why '32-bit colour' is a misnomer when
      regarding display colour depth. In reality, 32-bit colour
      actually refers to 24-bit colour (true colour) with or without
      an @{"alpha channel" LINK "Alpha Channel"}.

   c) 16 Bits Per Channel

      It may seem strange, why we need more than 8 bits per channel
      if our eye will not notice the difference. The problem is when
      we apply some operations on an 8-bit per channel image (for
      example, tone adjustment or colour enhancement), some colour
      information can be lost or distorted due roundoff errors. It is
      especially noticeable when we apply these operation several
      times. To avoid this problem, we should increase colour depth.
      That is why most scanners produces 48-bit images instead of 24-
      bit.

      Note that zView does not support currently 16-bit per channel
      images.

The DEGAS format was originally developed as a proprietary format for
the painting program of the same name (later upgraded to DEGAS
Elite), but has since become a common image format on ST computers.
Most Atari ST painting programs read DEGAS images in addition to
other formats.


DEGAS, the Painting Program
@line 1 60 0 0 7

DEGAS was one of the first painting packages to arrive on the Atari
ST (released in 1986) and one of the biggest-selling ST programs at
that time. DEGAS, an contrived acronym for Design & Entertainment
Graphic Arts System and the impressionist Edgar Degas, was created by
Tom Hudson for Batteries Included, Canada. A lot of classic ST
graphics have been made with it.

With the introduction of the successor program, DEGAS Elite, by the
same author, a new version of the DEGAS format was defined (PC1, PC2,
PC3). It supports compression, and animation effects by changing the
values in the @{"palette" LINK "Colour Depth"}. And through the resolutions available on the
TT, further screen sizes were supported: 320x480 pixels in 256
colours (PI4/PC4), 640x480 in 16 colours (PI5/PC5) and 1280x960
monochrome (PI6/PC6).

The microprocessor of the Atari Falcon is supported by a Digital
Signal Processor (DSP), a Motorola DSP56001 clocked at 32 MHz
performing no less than 16 million instructions per second. Although
it is oriented to sound processing (it is directly connected to the
RAM and AD/DA converter via an interconnection matrix), it is also
capable of graphics processing, such as calculation of fractals,
deformations, 3D projections and JPEG decompression. It can even,
jointly with the 68030, play MP3 files in real-time.

Exchangeable Image File Format (official abbreviation is Exif, not
EXIF) is a standard that specifies the formats for images, sound, and
ancillary information fields (tags) used by digital cameras
(including smartphones), scanners and other systems handling image
and sound files recorded by digital cameras. The specification uses
the following existing file formats with the addition of specific
metadata tags: JPEG DCT for compressed image files, TIFF Rev. 6.0
(@{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} or YCbCr) for uncompressed image files, and RIFF WAV for audio
files (Linear PCM or u-Law PCM for uncompressed audio data, and IMA-
ADPCM for compressed audio data). It is not supported in the JPEG
successor JPEG2000 (which is, by the way, not widely supported), or
in PNG and GIF.

This standard consists of the Exif image file specification and the
Exif audio file specification.

Since Exif inserts data to images in conformity to the image format
specification, you can view image files with Exif data by any web
browser, graphics viewer and so on.


Background and History of the Exif Standard
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Exif was created by the Japan Electronic Industries Development
Association (JEIDA). The latest version 2.3, dated April 2010, was
jointly formulated by the Japan Electronics and Information
Technology Industries Association (JEITA) and Camera Imaging Products
Association (CIPA). Though the specification is not currently
maintained by any industry or standards organisation, its use by
camera manufacturers is nearly universal.

The following list provides information about the history of the Exif
standard.

 @{B}Version  Date            Description@{b}

 2.21     September 2003  Added optional @{"colour space" LINK "Colour Depth"} (Adobe @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"})
@line 2 69 0 0 7
 Unified  September 2009  Amendment of Exif Ver 2.2, which was a
 Version                  separate volume having additional parts and
 2.21                     modifications, was merged into Exif Ver 2.2
                          as a unified version
@line 2 69 0 0 7
 2.3      April 2010      Added and revised tags (sensivity-related
                          tags, GPS information, camera and lens
                          information, items pertaining to sound
                          files, and light-source colour)
@line 2 69 0 0 7


Exif Data
@line 1 60 0 0 7

The metadata tags defined in the Exif standard cover a broad spectrum:
 - Date and time information. Digital cameras will record the current
   date and time and save this in the metadata.
 - Camera settings. This includes static information such as the
   camera model and make, and information that varies with each
   image, such as the orientation (rotation), the aperture, the
   shutter speed, the lens used and the ISO speed setting.
 - A thumbnail for previewing the picture on the camera's LCD screen
   or in computer programs.
 - Descriptions and copyright information.

Furthermore, the standard allows to store so-called maker notes,
which allows camera manufacturers to place any custom format
information in the file. This is used increasingly by camera
manufacturers to store myriad camera settings not listed in the Exif
standard, such as shooting modes, post-processing settings, serial
number and focusing modes. As this maker note format is proprietary
and manufacturer-specific, it can be prohibitively difficult to
retrieve this information from an image. Some manufacturers encrypt
portions of the information.


Drawbacks
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Apart from not being a maintained standard, the Exif format has a
number of drawbacks, mostly relating to its use of legacy file
structures. Here are some examples:

 ù The derivation of Exif from the TIFF file structure using offset
   pointers in the files means that data can be spread anywhere
   within a file, which means that software is likely to corrupt any
   pointers or corresponding data that it does not decode/encode. For
   this reason most image editors damage or remove the Exif metadata
   to some extent upon saving.

 ù The standard only allows TIFF or JPEG files, and thus there is no
   provision for a 'raw' file type which would be a direct data dump
   from the sensor device. This has caused camera manufacturers to
   invent many proprietary, incompatible 'raw' file formats.

 ù Photo manipulation software sometimes fails to update the embedded
   thumbnail after an editing operation, possibly causing the user to
   inadvertently publish compromising information.

 ù Exif metadata are restricted in size to 64 KB in JPEG images. This
   has prompted some camera manufacturers to develop non-standard
   techniques for storing the large preview images used by some
   digital cameras for LCD review. These non-standard extensions are
   commonly lost if a user re-saves the image using image editor
   software, possibly rendering the image incompatible with the
   original camera that created it.

 ù There is no way to record time-zone information along with the
   time, thus rendering the stored time ambiguous.

 ù Since the Exif tag contains information about the photo, it can
   pose a privacy issue. For example, a photo taken with a GPS-
   enabled camera can reveal the exact location it was taken, which
   is undesirable in some situations.

The aims of the project are:

 ù Develop a new Atari-compatible computer to offer available
   hardware to the Atari community and other interested people.

 ù Find a well-balanced and doable solution between compatibility to
   original Atari hardware and a reasonable price.

 ù Build a computer which will be the fastest available GEM hardware,
   and which can use every 'clean' GEM program right from the start.

 ù Create a computer which has the possibility to expand and - as a
   long-time goal - to become compatible to any 16/32-bit Atari that
   has ever been built.

 ù Develop a machine which has enough power and potential to
   implement further developments like a DSP, DVD-decoder and more
   with VHDL.

 ù Build an Atari-compatible computer that uses as many free licenses
   as possible to make way for later developments.

 ù An open project for everyone who wants to participate and help. A
   complete computer, which should be as far as possible open source.
   Not only the software, even the hardware shall be open.


At the Atari Coldfire Project, there are many persons involved, in
one or another way. There are also two companies on board: Medusa
Computer Systems (Fredi Aschwanden), and Milan Computer (Kassian A.
Goukassian). Both companies have no commercial interest and give
their knowledge for free. Medusa Computer Systems from Switzerland is
producing the hardware, will grant the warranty and so on.

The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) is a bitmap image format that
was introduced by CompuServe in 1987 and has since come into
widespread usage on the internet due to its wide support and
portability.

The format supports up to 8-bit colour thus allowing a single image
to reference a @{"palette" LINK "Colour Depth"} of up to 256 distinct colours. The colours are
chosen from the 24-bit @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} @{"colour space" LINK "Colour Depth"}. It also supports animations
and allows a separate @{"palette" LINK "Colour Depth"} of 256 colours for each frame. The
colour limitation makes the GIF format unsuitable for reproducing
colour photographs and other images with continuous colour, but it is
well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid
areas of colour.

GIF images are compressed using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless
data compression technique to reduce the file size without degrading
the visual quality. This compression technique was patented in 1985.
Controversy over the licensing agreement between the patent holder,
Unisys, and CompuServe in 1994 spurred the development of the
Portable Network Graphics (PNG) standard; since then all the relevant
patents have expired.


Pronunciation
@line 1 60 0 0 7

The creators of the format pronounced GIF with a soft 'G', as in
'gin'. An alternative pronunciation uses a hard 'G', as in
'graphics', reflecting the expanded acronym. Both pronunciations are
given as correct by the Oxford English Dictionary and the American
Heritage Dictionary.

According to Steve Wilhite, the creator of the GIF format, the
original pronunciation deliberately echoes the American peanut butter
brand, Jif, and the employees of CompuServe would often say 'Choosy
developers choose GIF', spoofing this brand's television
commercials.


History
@line 1 60 0 0 7

The CompuServe GIF was created to upload documents to the CompuServe
Information Service and to pass documents between other types of
computers. One of the ideas behind designing GIF files was to create
the smallest possible image file for uploading and downloading from
electronic Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), thus producing a highly
compressed format that minimises file transfer time over phone lines.
The compression is accomplished by using the LZW method for @{"palette" LINK "Colour Depth"}
tables.

The original version of the GIF format was called 87a. In 1989,
CompuServe devised an enhanced version, called 89a, which added
transparency (allows you to specify transparent areas in the image so
that the background on which the image is placed will come through),
support for animation delays (multiple images in a stream were
already supported in 87a), and storage of textual and application-
specific metadata. The 89a specification also supports rendering
textual data with some parameters as a graphic, in a simple form, but
as there is little control over display fonts, this feature is not
widely used. The two versions can be distinguished by looking at the
first six bytes of the file (the 'magic number' or 'signature'),
which, when interpreted as ASCII, read 'GIF87a' and 'GIF89a',
respectively.


Stream-Based Format
@line 1 60 0 0 7

GIF was also designed as an image communications protocol used for
the interactive viewing of online images. Therefore, GIF is different
from many other common picture formats: it is stream-based. That
means that a communication program (for BBSs and the internet) can
download GIF files and view them from top to bottom as they are being
downloaded.


Interlacing
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Another feature of GIF allows the user to get a good idea of what the
image will look like before even half of the image is decoded. GIF
may use an optional encoding method referred to as interlacing. When
an image is saved by using four passes instead of just one, it is
called interlacing. On each pass, certain lines of the image are
saved to the file. If the program decoding a GIF file displays the
image as it is decoded, the user will be able to see the four passes
of the decoding cycle. If the user does not like the image, the
download can be aborted.


Animation
@line 1 60 0 0 7

The feature of storing multiple images in one file, accompanied by
control data, is used extensively on the web to produce simple
animations.

GIF makes animations possible which repeats continually, or
animations which run once or several times and stop at the last frame.


Graphics Applications
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Both the 87a and 89a specifications allow @{"palette" LINK "Colour Depth"} or colour tables of
2^n colours for any n from 1 through 8. A small colour table may
suffice for small images, and keeping the colour table small allows
the file to be downloaded faster. Most graphics applications will
read and display GIF images with any of these table sizes, but some
do not support all sizes when creating images. Tables of 2, 16 and
256 colours are widely supported.

Frustrated with the speed and reliability of the existing art
packages for the @{"high-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} mode (65,536 colours) of the Falcon, Mr
Pink of the scene group Reservoir Gods wrote GodPaint.

In 1994, Reservoir Gods were formed as a software team developing
products for Atari computers. They created an incredible amount of
high-quality shareware and freeware games. There releases included
the games Double Bobble 2000, Chu Chu Rocket, SuperFly and Clogged
Up. They used GodPaint to create all the graphics on all their
productions; and it was used by other groups, such as Avena in the
creation of such demos as Sonolumineszenz.

JPEG, pronounced as 'jay - peg', is a commonly used method of lossy
compression for digital photography (image). The degree of
compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable trade off between
storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1
compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.

JPEG compression is used in a number of image file formats. JPEG/Exif
is the most common image format used by digital cameras and other
photographic image capture devices; along with JPEG/JFIF, it is the
most common format for storing and transmitting photographic images
on the internet. These format variations are often not distinguished,
and are simply called JPEG.

JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the name of the
committee that created the JPEG standard and other standards. The
group was organised in 1986 and issued the first JPEG standard in
1992.

The JPEG standard specifies the @{"codec" LINK "Codec"}, which defines how an image is
compressed into a stream of bytes and decompressed back into an
image, but not the file format used to contain that stream. The JFIF
and Exif standards define the commonly used file formats for
interchange of JPEG-compressed images.


JPEG Files
@line 1 60 0 0 7

The file format known as JPEG Interchange Format (JIF) is specified
in Annex B of the JPEG standard. However, this 'pure' file format is
rarely used, primarily because of the difficulty of programming
encoders and decoders that fully implement all aspects of the
standard and because of certain shortcomings of the standard.

For example, JIF does not define which colour encoding is to be used
for images. JFIF defines the @{"colour model" LINK "Colour Depth"} to be used: either Y for
greyscale, or YCbCr. Since this is not an absolute @{"colour space" LINK "Colour Depth"} -
unless an ICC profile, @{"colour space" LINK "Colour Depth"} metadata, or an sRGB tag is
provided and interpreted - a decoded JFIF image will be in a device-
dependent @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} @{"colour space" LINK "Colour Depth"}. Hence, JFIF does not by itself provide a
mechanism for accurately transporting colour-managed images across
the internet.

Other details that are unspecified by JIF: component sub-sampling
registration, and resolution or aspect ratio definition.

Several additional standards have evolved to address these issues.
The first of these, released in 1992, was JPEG File Interchange
Format (or JFIF), followed in recent years by Exchangeable Image File
Format (Exif) and ICC colour profiles. Both of these formats use the
actual JIF byte layout, consisting of different markers, but in
addition employ one of the JIF standard's extension points, namely
the application markers: JFIF use APP0, while Exif use APP1. Within
these segments of the file, that were left for future use in the JIF
standard and are not read by it, these standards add specific
metadata.

Thus, in some ways JFIF is a cut-down version of the JIF standard in
that it specifies certain constraints (such as not allowing all the
different encoding modes), while in other ways it is an extension of
JIF due to the added metadata. The documentation for the original
JFIF standard states:

 'JPEG File Interchange Format is a minimal file format which enables
 JPEG bitstreams to be exchanged between a wide variety of platforms
 and applications. This minimal format does not include any of the
 advanced features found in the TIFF JPEG specification or any
 application specific file format. Nor should it, for the only
 purpose of this simplified format is to allow the exchange of JPEG
 compressed images.'

Image files that employ JPEG compression are commonly called 'JPEG
files', and are stored in variants of the JIF image format. Most
image capture devices (such as digital cameras) that output JPEG are
actually creating files in the Exif format, the format that the
camera industry has standardised on for metadata interchange. On the
other hand, since the Exif standard does not allow colour profiles,
most image editing software stores JPEG in JFIF format, and also
include the APP1 segment from the Exif file to include the metadata
in an almost-compliant way; the JFIF standard is interpreted somewhat
flexibly.

Formally, the JFIF and Exif standards are incompatible because they
each specify that their marker segment (APP0 or APP1, respectively)
appears first. In practice, many programs and digital cameras produce
files with both application segments included. This will not affect
the image decoding for most decoders, but poorly designed JFIF or
Exif parsers may not recognise the file properly. Since most JPEG
files contain a JFIF marker segment that precedes the Exif header,
this allows older readers to correctly handle the older format JFIF
segment, while newer readers also decode the following Exif segment,
being less strict about requiring it to appear first.

Many JPEG files embed an ICC colour profile. Commonly used colour
profiles include sRGB and Adobe @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"}. However, many applications are
not able to deal with JPEG colour profiles and simply ignore them.

Both the JFIF and Exif standards allow a thumbnail of the main image
to be embedded inside the file.


Typical Usage
@line 1 60 0 0 7

The JPEG compression algorithm is at its best on photographs and
paintings of realistic scenes with smooth variations of tone and
colour. For web usage, where the amount of data used for an image is
important, JPEG is very popular. JPEG/Exif is also the most common
format saved by digital cameras.

On the other hand, JPEG may not be as well suited for line drawings
and other textual or iconic graphics, where the sharp contrasts
between adjacent pixels can cause noticeable artifacts. Such images
may be better saved in a lossless graphics format such as TIFF, GIF,
PNG, or a raw image format. The JPEG standard actually includes a
lossless coding mode, but that mode is not supported in most
products.

As the typical use of JPEG is a lossy compression method, which
somewhat reduces the image fidelity, it should not be used in
scenarios where the exact reproduction of the data is required (such
as some scientific and medical imaging applications and certain
technical image processing work).

JPEG is also not well suited to files that will undergo multiple
edits, as some image quality will usually be lost each time the image
is decompressed and recompressed, particularly if the image is
cropped or shifted, or if encoding parameters are changed. To avoid
this, an image that is being modified or may be modified in the
future can be saved in a lossless format, with a copy exported as
JPEG for distribution.

@symbol a "JPEG Compression"

JPEG Compression
@line 1 60 0 0 7

JPEG is different in that it is primarily a lossy method of
compression. Most popular image format compression schemes, such as
RLE, LZW, or the CCITT standards, are lossless compression methods.
That is, they do not discard any data during the encoding process. An
image compressed using a lossless method is guaranteed to be
identical to the original image when uncompressed. Lossy schemes, on
the other hand, throw useless data away during encoding. This is, in
fact, how lossy schemes manage to obtain superior compression ratios
over most lossless schemes. JPEG was designed specifically to discard
information that the human eye cannot easily see. Slight changes in
colour are not perceived well by the human eye, while slight changes
in intensity (light and dark) are. Therefore, JPEG's lossy encoding
tends to be more frugal with the greyscale part of an image and to be
more frivolous with the colour.

The amount of compression achieved depends upon the content of the
image data. A typical photographic-quality image may be compressed
from 20:1 to 25:1 without experiencing any noticeable degradation in
quality. Higher compression ratios will result in image files that
differ noticeably from the original image but still have an overall
good image quality. And achieving a 20:1 or better compression ratio
in many cases not only saves disk space but also reduces transmission
time across data networks and phone lines. Therefore, along with GIF,
JPEG is one of the two standard image file formats used on web pages.

An end user can 'tune' the quality of a JPEG encoder using a
parameter sometimes called a 'quality setting' or a 'Q factor'.
Although different implementations have varying scales of Q factors,
a range of 1 to 100 is typical. A factor of 1 produces the smallest,
worst quality images; a factor of 100 produces the largest, best
quality images. The optimal Q factor depends on the image content and
is therefore different for every image. The exact threshold at which
errors become visible also depends on your viewing conditions. The
smaller an individual pixel, the harder it is to see an error; so
errors are more visible on a computer screen (at 70 or so dots/inch)
than on a high-quality colour printout (300 or more dots/inch). Thus,
a higher-resolution image can tolerate more compression which is
fortunate considering it is much bigger to start with. The art of
JPEG compression is finding the lowest Q factor that produces an
image that is visibly acceptable, and preferably as close to the
original as possible.

A question that commonly arises is 'At what Q factor does JPEG become
lossless?' The answer is 'Never.' Baseline JPEG is a lossy method of
compression regardless of adjustments you may make in the parameters.
In fact, DCT-based encoders are always lossy, because roundoff errors
are inevitable in the colour transformation and DCT steps (see
section Encoding and Decoding Process, below). You can suppress
deliberate information loss in the downsampling and quantisation
steps, but you still will not get an exact recreation of the original
bits. Further, this minimum-loss setting is a very inefficient way to
use lossy JPEG.


Compression Artifacts
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Those who use the internet may be familiar with the irregularities
known as compression artifacts that appear in JPEG images, which may
take the form of noise around contrasting edges (especially curves
and corners), or blocky images, commonly known as 'jaggies'. They are
especially noticeable around sharp corners between contrasting
colours (text is a good example as it contains many such corners).
The analogous artifacts in MPEG video are referred to as mosquito
noise as the resulting 'edge busyness' and spurious dots, which
change over time, resemble mosquitoes swarming around the object.


Baseline Specification
@line 1 60 0 0 7

The JPEG specification defines a minimal subset of the standard
called baseline JPEG, which all JPEG-aware applications are required
to support. This baseline uses an encoding scheme based on the
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to achieve compression. DCT is a
generic name for a class of operations identified and published some
time ago. DCT-based algorithms have since made their way into various
compression methods.

DCT algorithms are capable of achieving a high degree of compression
with only minimal loss of data. This scheme is effective only for
compressing continuous-tone images in which the differences between
adjacent pixels are usually small. In practice, JPEG works well only
on images with depths of at least four or five bits per @{"colour" LINK "Colour Depth"}
@{"channel" LINK "Colour Depth"}. The baseline standard actually specifies 8 bits per input
@{"channel" LINK "Colour Depth"}. Data of lesser bit depth can be handled by scaling it up to
8 bits per @{"channel" LINK "Colour Depth"}, but the results will be bad for low-bit-depth
source data, because of the large jumps between adjacent pixel
values. For similar reasons, @{"colour-mapped" LINK "Colour Depth"} source data does not work
very well, especially if the image has been dithered.


Encoding and Decoding Process
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Here is a brief description of the encoding process that consists of
several steps:
 - @{"Colour space" LINK "Colour Depth"} transformation: The representation of the colours in
   the image is converted from @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} to YCbCr, consisting of one luma
   component (Y), representing brightness, and two chroma components
   (Cb and Cr), representing colour. However, some JPEG
   implementations in 'highest quality' mode do not apply this step
   and instead keep the colour information in the @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} @{"colour model" LINK "Colour Depth"}.
 - Downsampling: The resolution of the chroma data is reduced,
   usually by a factor of 2. This reflects the fact that the eye is
   less sensitive to fine colour details than to fine brightness
   details. Remarkably, this 50 percent reduction in data volume has
   almost no effect on the perceived quality of most images.
 - Block splitting: The image is split into blocks of 8x8 pixels
 - DCT: For each block, each of the Y, Cb, and Cr data undergoes a
   Discrete Cosine Transform. It is similar to a Fourier transform in
   the sense that it produces a kind of spatial frequency spectrum.
   The DCT step itself is lossless except for roundoff errors.
 - Quantisation: The amplitudes of the frequency components are
   quantised. Human vision is much more sensitive to small variations
   in colour or brightness over large areas than to the strength of
   high-frequency brightness variations. Therefore, the magnitudes of
   the high-frequency components are stored with a lower accuracy
   than the low-frequency components. The quality setting of the
   encoder (for example, 50 or 95 on a scale of 0-100 in the
   Independent JPEG Group's library; this library is used by zView)
   affects to what extent the resolution of each frequency component
   is reduced. If an excessively low quality setting is used, the
   high-frequency components are discarded altogether.
 - Additional compression: The resulting data for all 8x8 blocks is
   further compressed with a lossless algorithm, a variant of Huffman
   encoding.

The decoding process reverses these steps, except the downsampling
and quantisation steps because they are irreversible (information
loss in that steps).


Extensions to the Specification
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Only the baseline specification for JPEG have been examined thus far.
A number of extensions have been defined in Part 1 of the JPEG
specification that provide progressive image buildup (see next
section), improved compression ratios using arithmetic encoding
(slower and you need a license) and a lossless compression scheme.
These features are beyond the needs of most JPEG implementations and
have therefore been defined as 'not required to be supported'
extensions to the JPEG standard.


Progressive JPEG
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Progressive image buildup is ideal for large images that will be
displayed while downloading over a slow connection, allowing a
reasonable preview after receiving only a portion of the data. A
baseline JPEG image can be displayed only after all of the image data
has been received and decoded. Using a conventional compression
method, this means displaying the first few scan lines of the image
as it is decoded. In this case, even if the scan lines were
interlaced, you would need at least 50 percent of the image data to
get a good clue as to the content of the image. The progressive
buildup extension of JPEG offers a better solution.

Progressive buildup allows an image to be sent in layers rather than
scan lines. But instead of transmitting each @{"bit plane" LINK "Colour Depth"} or @{"colour" LINK "Colour Depth"}
@{"channel" LINK "Colour Depth"} in sequence (which would not be very useful), a succession of
images built up from approximations of the original image are sent.
The first scan provides a low-accuracy representation of the entire
image - in effect, a very low-quality JPEG compressed image.
Subsequent scans gradually refine the image by increasing the
effective quality factor. If the data is displayed on the fly, you
would first see a crude, but recognisable, rendering of the whole
image. This would appear very quickly because only a small amount of
data would need to be transmitted to produce it. Each subsequent scan
would improve the displayed image's quality one block at a time. Of
course, this means that each scan of a progressive JPEG takes
essentially a full JPEG decompression cycle to display.

However, progressive JPEGs are not as widely supported, and even some
software which does support them (such as some versions of
Microsoft's web browser Internet Explorer for Windows) only displays
the image once it has been completely downloaded.

In French, LDG stands for Librairies Dynamiques GEM or, in English,
GEM Dynamical Libraries. It is a protocol allowing GEM applications
to load and share libraries (or plugins if you prefer). The goal of
LDG is to provide some useful functions to GEM applications like the
WinDeath DDL. These libraries are dynamical, for example, they are
loaded when the application need it and unloaded when they are
unused. These libraries may be shared with several clients. Libraries
can have special rights, such as unshareable, memory resident or
locked. The LDG works with all TOS-compatible computers, and TOS-
compatible operating systems such as MagiC, Geneva, MiNT or plain TOS.

LDG has several advantages compared to MagiC Shared Libraries (SLB):

 ù LDG libraries are dynamical. They can be loaded or unloaded
   dynamically. Magic loads SLB libraries while booting: unused
   libraries can decrease free memory dramatically. However, FreeMiNT
   since version 1.15(?) handles SLB dynamically.

 ù LDG libraries can be shared, duplicated or not. SLB libraries are
   always shared.

 ù An LDG library is easy to create compared to an SLB library, no
   assembler is required.

 ù LDG works currently on any TOS-based system.

 ù LDG can work without any system extension. SLB can only be used
   using an SLB driver (MagiC, FreeMiNT, and plain TOS with MetaDOS
   extension). For example, the LDG installer works perfectly with
   plain TOS although it uses the FileUtil LDG library.

The NEOchrome format was originally developed for use with the
painting program of the same name. It is limited in that it can only
represent ST screen-sized images with 2, 4, or 16 colours. Images are
always uncompressed.


NEOchrome, the Painting Program
@line 1 60 0 0 7

The NEOchrome picture format was a product of the Atari ST painting
program NEOchrome. It was an early bitmap graphics editor for the
Atari ST computer family and was written by Dave Staugas, a system
programmer at Atari and co-author of the ST's operating system. Along
with the first Amiga versions of Deluxe Paint, NEOchrome was one of
the earliest mainstream bitmap editors to use the then-novel
graphical user interface.

An early sampler version (v0.5) was released as part of the system
disks of the first STs. A 'proper' version 1.0 arrived later, and was
bundled with several versions of the ST. Although not officially
public domain, this version was often treated as such, and was never
actually sold. As a result of this, NEOchrome enjoyed a relatively
high level of popularity within the ST community, even in the face of
more advanced packages such as DEGAS Elite and Deluxe Paint.

Although there were no further official versions, an unofficial
revision called NEOchrome Master was released in the early 1990s by
Chaos, Inc. of the demo group The Delta Force. NEOchrome Master was
built by reassembling the binary program NEOchrome 1.0. This allowed
the author to extend the program. Many extensions were built into the
program, and various versions were released to the public.

by changing the values in the @{"palette" LINK "Colour Depth"}. In addition, there is a

Portable Document Format (PDF) is an open standard for document
exchange. This file format created by Adobe Systems in 1993 is used
for representing documents in a manner that is independent of the
original application software, hardware and operating systems. Each
PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat
document, including the text, fonts, graphics and other information
needed to display it.

While the PDF specification was available for free since at least
2001, PDF was originally a proprietary format controlled by Adobe,
and was officially released as an open standard in 2008 and published
by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO
32000-1:2008. Also in 2008, Adobe published a Public Patent License
to ISO 32000-1 granting a royalty-free rights for all patents owned
by Adobe that are necessary to make, use, sell and distribute PDF
compliant implementations.


History
@line 1 60 0 0 7

PDF's adoption in the early days of the format's history was slow.
Adobe Acrobat, Adobe's suite for reading and creating PDF files, was
not freely available; early versions of PDF had no support for
external hyperlinks, reducing its usefulness on the internet; the
larger size of a PDF document compared to plain text required longer
download times over the slower modems common at the time; and
rendering PDF files was slow on the less powerful machines of the
day. Additionally, there were competing formats such as DjVu (still
developing), Envoy, Common Ground Digital Paper, Farallon Replica and
even Adobe's own PostScript format (*.ps); in those early years,
PDF was popular mainly in desktop publishing workflows.

Adobe soon started distributing its Acrobat Reader (now Adobe Reader)
program at no cost, and continued supporting the original PDF, which
eventually became the de facto standard for printable documents on
the web (a standard web document).


Adobe's PDF Specifications
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Adobe changed the PDF specification several times and continues to
develop new specifications with new versions of Adobe Acrobat. There
have been nine versions of PDF with corresponding Acrobat
releases:
 - 1993  PDF 1.0 / Acrobat 1.0
 - 1994  PDF 1.1 / Acrobat 2.0
 - 1996  PDF 1.2 / Acrobat 3.0
 - 1999  PDF 1.3 / Acrobat 4.0
 - 2001  PDF 1.4 / Acrobat 5.0
 - 2003  PDF 1.5 / Acrobat 6.0
 - 2005  PDF 1.6 / Acrobat 7.0
 - 2006  PDF 1.7 / Acrobat 8.0
 - 2006  PDF 1.7 / Acrobat 8.2
 - 2008  PDF 1.7, Adobe Extension Level 3 / Acrobat 9.0
 - 2009  PDF 1.7, Adobe Extension Level 5 / Acrobat 9.1

The ISO standard ISO 32000-1:2008 and Adobe PDF 1.7 are technically
consistent. Adobe declared that it is not producing a PDF 1.8
Reference. The future versions of the PDF specification will be
produced by ISO technical committees. However, Adobe published
documents specifying what extended features for PDF, beyond ISO 32000-
1 (PDF 1.7), are supported in its newly released products. This makes
use of the extensibility features of PDF as documented in ISO 32000-1
in Annex E. Adobe declared all extended features in Adobe Extension
Level 3 and 5 have been accepted for a new proposal of ISO 32000-2
(also known as PDF 2.0).

The specifications for PDF are backward inclusive. The PDF 1.7
specification includes all of the functionality previously documented
in the Adobe PDF Specifications for versions 1.0 through 1.6. Where
Adobe removed certain features of PDF from their standard, they too
are not contained in ISO 32000-1.

PDF documents conforming to ISO 32000-1 carry the PDF version number
1.7. Documents containing Adobe extended features still carry the PDF
base version number 1.7 but also contain an indication of which

@line 1 60 0 0 7

A PDF file is often a combination of vector graphics, text and bitmap
graphics. The basic types of content in a PDF are:
 - text stored as content streams (this means not as text),
 - vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist
   of shapes and lines, and
 - raster graphics (bitmaps) for photographs and other types of image.

In later PDF revisions, a PDF document also allows interactive
elements, such as bookmarks (they appear on the left side of a PDF
document and take the reader to a specific page), links (in-text
clickable links directly to a page inside the document, to another
file or to a web page), annotations (annotate, highlight, and add
notes to already created PDF files), completable form fields and its
programming with JavaScript (initially available as plugin for
Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of embedded contents that can be
handled using plugins.


File Size
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Two PDF files that look similar on a computer screen may be of very
different sizes. For example, a high resolution raster image takes
more space than a low resolution one. Typically higher resolution is
needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen.
Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full
fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts and storing text as graphics.


Usage Restrictions
@line 1 60 0 0 7

A PDF file may be encrypted for security. The standard security
provided by Acrobat PDF consists of two different methods and two
different passwords, 'user password' and 'owner password'. A PDF
document may be protected by password to open (user password) and the
document may also specify operations that should be restricted even
when the document is decrypted: printing, copying text and graphics
out of the document, modifying the document, or adding or modifying
text notes and form fields (using owner password). However, if only a
owner password is used, all operations which are restricted by this
password are trivially circumvented by many commonly available 'PDF
cracking' software and even freely online, and if circumvented these
restrictions no longer let the author control what can and cannot be
done with the PDF file once distributed.

Even without removing the password, most freeware or open source PDF
readers will ignore the permission 'protections' and will allow the
user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document
were not limited by password protection.


Technical Foundations
@line 1 60 0 0 7

PDF is primarily the combination of three technologies:
 - a cut-down form of PostScript for generating the layout and
   graphics,
 - a font-embedding/replacement system to allow fonts to travel with
   the documents, and
 - a structured storage system to bundle these elements into a single
   file, with data compression where appropriate.


Fonts
@line 1 60 0 0 7

A font object in PDF is a description of a digital typeface. It may
either describe the characteristics of a typeface, or it may include
an embedded font file. The latter case is called an embedded font
while the former is called an unembedded font. The font files that
may be embedded are based on widely used standard digital font
formats: Type 1 (and its compressed variant CFF), TrueType and
(beginning with PDF 1.6) OpenType. Additionally PDF supports the Type
3 variant in which the components of the font are described by PDF
graphic operators.

There are fourteen Type 1 fonts known as 'standard 14 fonts' that
have a special significance to PDF documents:
 - Times (v3) (in regular, italic, bold and bold italic)
 - Courier (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)
 - Helvetica (v3) (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)
 - Symbol
 - Zapf Dingbats

These fonts are sometimes also referred to as the 'base fourteen
fonts'. These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same
metrics, must always be available in all PDF readers and so need not
be embedded in a PDF. PDF viewers must know about the metrics of
these fonts. Other fonts may be substituted if they are not embedded
in a PDF.

PNG, sometimes pronounced as 'ping', is a bitmapped image format that
employs lossless data compression. PNG was largely developed to deal
with some of the shortcomings of the GIF format and allows storage of
images with greater @{"colour depth" LINK "Colour Depth"} and other important information. The
initialism PNG can also be interpreted as a recursive initialism for
'PNG's Not GIF'.

PNG supports @{"palette-based" LINK "Colour Depth"} images (with @{"palettes" LINK "Colour Depth"} of 24-bit @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} or 32-
bit @{"RGBA" LINK "Colour Depth"} colours), greyscale images (with or without @{"alpha channel" LINK "Alpha Channel"}),
and @{"RGB[A]" LINK "Colour Depth"} images (with or without @{"alpha channel" LINK "Alpha Channel"}). PNG was designed
for transferring images on the internet, not for professional-quality
print graphics, and therefore does not support non-@{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} @{"colour spaces" LINK "Colour Depth"}
such as CMYK.

In 2004, PNG was published as an ISO/IEC standard.


History
@line 1 60 0 0 7

The motivation for creating the PNG format came in early 1995, after
Unisys announced that it would be enforcing software patents on the
LZW data compression algorithm used for GIF (in 2003 the patent
expired). There were also other problems with the GIF format which
made a replacement desirable, notably its limitation to 256 colours
at a time when computers capable of displaying far more than 256
colours were becoming common. Although GIF allows for animation, it
was decided that PNG should be a single-image format. A companion
format called Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) has been defined
for animation, whereas a competing format, Animated Portable Network
Graphics (APNG), supports backward-compatibility with PNG (which MNG
does not). PNG gained some additional popularity in August 1999,
after Unisys terminated its royalty-free patent licenses to
developers of free software and non-commercial software.


Compression
@line 1 60 0 0 7

PNG uses a non-patented lossless data compression method known as
Deflate. This method is combined with prediction, where for each
image line, a filter method is chosen that predicts the colour of
each pixel based on the colours of previous pixels and subtracts the
predicted colour of the pixel from the actual colour. An image line
filtered in this way is often more compressible than the raw image
line would be. On most images, PNG can achieve greater compression
than GIF, but some implementations make poor choices of filter
methods and therefore produce unnecessarily large PNG files.


Transparency
@line 1 60 0 0 7

The GIF file format has allowed portions of images to be transparent,
allowing them to appear to have a shape that is not rectangular.
However, the GIF method was considered to be insufficient because it
only allowed individual pixels to be fully transparent or fully
opaque. The PNG format allows three different styles of transparency:
one for @{"indexed-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} images and two for greyscale or @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"}
images. For @{"indexed-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} images, a table of 8-bit alpha values
(numeric values representing levels of partial transparency from
fully transparent to fully opaque) for @{"palette" LINK "Colour Depth"} entries is stored. Any
@{"palette" LINK "Colour Depth"} entries that do not have a corresponding alpha value are
considered to be fully opaque. For greyscale and @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} images,
either a single colour value can be set as transparent, or an @{"alpha" LINK "Alpha Channel"}
@{"channel" LINK "Colour Depth"} of the same bit depth as the main @{"channels" LINK "Colour Depth"} can be added to
the image. It should be noted that an @{"alpha channel" LINK "Alpha Channel"} cannot be used
with a 1-, 2- or 4-bit greyscale image though such an image could be
stored in a PNG by defining it as paletted and putting the alpha
values into the @{"palette" LINK "Colour Depth"}.


Interlacing
@line 1 60 0 0 7

PNG image data is typically stored as a series of scan lines starting
with the first line at the top of the image and progressing
sequentially to the last line at the bottom of the image. PNG image
data may also be stored in a specific interlace pattern to allow a
progressive display of the image data from a low resolution to a full
resolution display.

Progressive display is most useful when receiving a PNG file over a
slow transmission link (like the one that connects your web browser
to the internet). The gradual 'fade in' effect typically allows a
user to discern the content of the image before it has displayed in
its entirety. This feature is very useful if the image is a menu on a
web page or a picture that you do not wish to waste the time
downloading. It is also a requirement that all PNG readers be able to
interpret interlaced image data, although PNG viewers need not
support the ability to perform a progressive display.

A typical interlace scheme, such as that used by GIF, simply
rearranges the order in which the scan lines are stored. For example,
rather than storing lines sequentially as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...,
an interlace scheme might store scan lines as 0, 8, 4, 9, 2, 10, 5,
... in the file. GIF uses this type of interlacing scheme and stores
(or transmits) image data in four passes of 1/8, 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2.
PNG takes a somewhat different approach by interlacing images using a
seven-pass scheme known as Adam7, after its inventor Adam M.
Costello. Adam7 uses the first six passes to build up all even-
numbered scan lines (0, 2, 4, 6, ...) and the final (seventh) pass to
fill in the remaining odd-numbered scan lines (1, 3, 5, 7, ...) in
the image. Rather than containing the pixels for entire scan lines,
the initial six passes contain specific pixels of only every other
scan line. The first two passes each contain 1/64th of the pixels in
the image. The third pass contains 1/32nd, the fourth pass 1/16th,
the fifth pass 1/8th, the sixth pass 1/4th and the seventh (final)
pass 1/2 of the image data. The image itself is built up on the
display, first as 8x8 squares, then 4x8 rectangles, then 4x4 squares,
then 2x4 rectangles, then 2x2 squares and then 1x2 rectangles. The
final pass fills in the pixels of the odd-numbered scan lines.

Adam7 interlacing allows the progressive buildup of pixels to appear
much more quickly on the display than it would if entire scan lines
were displayed. The pixels in the image are also displayed in a more
dispersed pattern, allowing the human eye to discern the typical
interlaced PNG image after only 20 to 30 percent of the image data
has been received, compared with the 50 percent or more needed from
the GIF interlacing scheme. Note, however, that PNG's interlacing
method does trade off a bit of size for speed. The GIF interlacing
scheme simply rearranges the storage order of scan lines and does not
have much impact on the storage space per scan line. In the PNG
scheme, each pass except the last carries non-adjacent pixels; for
example, pass 1 contains every 8th pixel from every 8th line. On the
average, there is less correlation between such pixels than there is
between adjacent pixels. This means that compression is less
effective on the interlaced data than it is on sequentially presented
data, so the resulting file is bigger. Typically, an interlaced file
will be up to 10 percent larger than an equivalent non-interlaced
file. For most applications where interlacing is useful, this price
is well worth paying in exchange for faster buildup of a useful image.


Web Browser Support for PNG
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Despite calls by the Free Software Foundation and the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), tools such as gif2png, and campaigns such as Burn
All @{"GIFs" LINK "GIF"}, PNG adoption on websites has been fairly slow due to late
and buggy support in Microsoft's web browser Internet Explorer
(Windows). Versions below 9.0 have numerous problems which prevent it
from correctly rendering PNG images.

GIF is found to be in use more than PNG for further reasons:
 - PNG images are less widely supported (for example, older web
   browsers and office software).
 - GIF intrinsically supports animated images, whereas PNG supports
   animation only via unofficial extensions (see section History,
   above).


Image Editing Software
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Image editing software varies in its treatment of PNGs.

Because GIF is limited to 256 colours, image editors must
automatically reduce the @{"colour depth" LINK "Colour Depth"} when saving an image in GIF
format. Often, when people save the same @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} image as PNG and
GIF, they see that the GIF is smaller, and do not realise that this
is due to the @{"colour depth" LINK "Colour Depth"} reduction, and that it is possible to
create a 256-colour PNG that has identical quality to the GIF with a
smaller file size. Further, some tools may automatically create PNG
files as 24-bit, even if the source image is 8-bit, bloating the
file. This leads to the misconception that PNG files are larger than
equivalent GIF files.

Some versions of Adobe Photoshop, CorelDRAW and MS Paint provide poor
PNG compression effort, further fueling the idea that PNG is larger
than GIF. Many PC and Mac graphics programs save PNGs with large
amounts of metadata as well as gamma- and colour-correction data that
are generally unnecessary for web viewing.

Truevision TGA, often referred to as TARGA, is a raster graphics
(bitmap) file format created by Truevision Inc. (now acquired by Avid
Technology) that was introduced in 1984. It was the native format of
TARGA and VISTA boards, which were the first graphics cards for IBM-
compatible PCs to support @{"high-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"}/@{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} display. This
family of graphics cards was intended for professional computer image
synthesis and video editing with PCs; for this reason, usual
resolutions of TGA image files match those of the NTSC and PAL video
formats.

TARGA is an acronym for Truevision Advanced Raster Graphics Adapter;
TGA is an initialism for Truevision Graphics Adapter.

The format can store image data with 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits - the
maximum 24 bits of @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} and an extra 8-bit @{"alpha channel" LINK "Alpha Channel"}. Colour data
can be @{"colour-mapped" LINK "Colour Depth"}, or in @{"direct-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} or @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} format.

TGA files are in widespread use due to their simplicity and ease of
implementation and lack of encumbering patents.


Old and New TGA Format
@line 1 60 0 0 7

In 1989, the TGA format was revised, and Truevision has chosen to
designate the old and new formats as original TGA format and new TGA
format, respectively. The original TGA format is very simple in
design and quite easy to implement in code. This makes it an
appealing format for developers to work with. As the available
hardware technology has become more complex, however, additional file
format features, such as the storage of gamma- and colour-correction
information and pixel-aspect-ratio data, have become necessary. The
new TGA format was created as a wrapper around the original TGA
format to add functionality without sacrificing backwards
compatibility with older applications.


Usage
@line 1 60 0 0 7

At the time, another technically superior file format called TIFF
also appeared, but its use for @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} images was very limited as
the implementation and sharing of files between applications
supporting the TIFF specification was rather difficult and involved.
The TGA file format's simplistic nature and portability between
platforms is the main reason for its widespread adoption and its
continued success in a wide variety of applications worldwide to this
day.


Compression
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Image data may be stored raw, or optionally, a lossless Macintosh RLE
(also known as PackBits) compression can be employed. This method
performs poorly when compressing images with many colour variations,
such as digital photos, but works well for textures and simpler
images.

TIFF is a file format for storing images, popular among graphic
artists, the publishing industry, and both amateur and professional
photographers in general. As of 2009, it is under the control of
Adobe Systems. Originally created by the company Aldus for use with
desktop publishing, the TIFF format is widely supported by image-
manipulation applications, desktop publishing, scanning, faxing, word
processing, optical character recognition and other applications.
Adobe Systems, which acquired Aldus, now holds the copyright to the
TIFF specification. TIFF has not had a major update since 1992,
although two supplements have been published with minor extensions to
the format and several other specifications have been based on the
TIFF 6.0 specification, like the electronic photography format
TIFF/EP (which, by the way, has not been adopted by most camera
manufacturers).


History
@line 1 60 0 0 7

TIFF was originally created as an attempt to get desktop scanner
vendors of the mid-1980s to agree on a common scanned image file
format, rather than have each company promote its own proprietary
format. In the beginning, TIFF was only a binary image format (only
two possible values for each pixel), because that was all that
desktop scanners could handle. As scanners became more powerful, and
as desktop computer disk space became more plentiful, TIFF grew to
accommodate greyscale images, then colour images. Today, TIFF is a
popular format for @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} images, along with JPEG and PNG.

The first version of the TIFF specification was published by Aldus
Corporation in the autumn of 1986 after two major earlier draft
releases. It can be labelled as Revision 3.0. It was published after
a series of meetings with various scanner manufacturers and software
developers. In April 1987, Revision 4.0 was released and it contained
mostly minor enhancements. In October 1988, Revision 5.0 was
released, and it added support for @{"palette-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} images and LZW
compression.


Differences Between TIFF and Other Formats
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Many picture formats have an image header with fixed fields
containing information, such as image dimensions or @{"colour model" LINK "Colour Depth"}
specification. The TIFF file format is different in that it allows
for a flexible set of information fields. There exists a
specification for many of these information fields, called tags,
ranging from the most fundamental, like image dimensions, over the
most luxurious, like copyright information, up to so-called private
tags or custom tags that you can define to hold your own application
specific information. The TIFF specification defines a framework for
an image header called Image File Directory (IFD) that is essentially
a flexible set of specifically those tags that the TIFF writer
software wishes to specify.

The clear benefit of this scheme is that almost any information can
accompany an image, while little information is absolutely needed,
and image headers remain as lean as possible; there is little
overhead and enough flexibility to suit any need.

Another major difference between most other picture formats and TIFF,
is that TIFF allows for a wide range of different compression schemes
and @{"colour models" LINK "Colour Depth"}. These are specified in dedicated tags. Where other
file formats are often designed to suit a single compression method,
TIFF allows for JPEG, the infamous LZW or the free-as-a-bird Deflate
compression, amongst many others. The same goes for @{"colour models" LINK "Colour Depth"}.
Theoretically, you could even use any compression method and @{"colour" LINK "Colour Depth"}
@{"model" LINK "Colour Depth"}  of your own, but, of course, this would result in crippled
portability. Unless restricted by the nature of the chosen
compression algorithm, any @{"colour model" LINK "Colour Depth"} and any @{"colour depth" LINK "Colour Depth"} can be
combined with any compression scheme.

And the same goes for bit depths and data types, too. One of the
powerful TIFF features is support for a wide range of data types. You
can store signed or unsigned integers, floating point values and even
complex data in the TIFF file. Combined with the possibility to store
an arbitrary number of @{"image channels" LINK "Colour Depth"}, this makes TIFF a very useful
format to store scientific data.

One final important difference between TIFF and most other image file
formats is that TIFF defines support for multiple images in a single
file. Such a file is then called multi-page TIFF. Thus, the TIFF
format is very well suited to, for example, store the many pages of a
single fax in a single file.


Baseline TIFF
@line 1 60 0 0 7

When TIFF was introduced, its extensibility provoked compatibility
problems and gave rise to the joke that TIFF stands for 'Thousands of
Incompatible File Formats'. The flexibility in encoding makes it very
easy to write a TIFF writer, but very difficult to create a fully
TIFF-compliant reader. To avoid compatibility problems, every TIFF
reader was required to read 'Baseline TIFF'. The Baseline TIFF does
not include layers, or compression with JPEG or LZW.

The following is an incomplete list of required Baseline TIFF
features:
 - Multiple images (although the TIFF reader is not required to do
   anything with images after the first one).
 - Compression schemes: no compression, CCITT 1D (Huffman) and
   Macintosh RLE (PackBits).
 - Image types: monochrome, greyscale, @{"palette-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} and @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} @{"full-" LINK "Colour Depth"}
   @{"colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} images.

TIFF readers are required to ignore tags that they do not recognise,
and a registered developer's private tags are guaranteed not to clash
with anyone else's tags or with the standard set of tags defined in
the specification.


Drawbacks
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Theoretically, TIFF is as flexible and suitable for a variety of
applications as very advanced formats like PSD (Adobe's Photoshop
Document format). In fact, the clean simplicity as well as openness
of the format is a major plus over a format like PSD. The TIFF format
is owned by the same company that also owns PSD, though, and as such,
it is not very surprising that it has not had a major update since
1992. That is probably the single most important drawback of TIFF: it
lacks standardised support for advanced imaging features that were
developed over the years. For instance, there is no standardised way
to specify multi-layer relationships of different TIFF pages, even
though a dedicated tag definition would be very feasible and very
suitable. Neither is there a standardised tag for vector or text
drawings.

One other drawback of TIFF, that it shares with the majority of other
file formats, is its size limitation. The format uses 32-bit offsets,
and as such, it is limited to 4 GB.

The GEM IMG file format, IMG for short, is an image file format used
to store bitmap digital images the Graphical Environment Manager
(GEM), developed and marketed by Digital Research. On Atari GEM, the
original GEM IMG format was extended to store @{"colour palette" LINK "Colour Depth"}
information with the file. Additionally, some time later, @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"}
versions of the format were developed.

To distinguish between the GEM vector graphics file format GEM
Metafile and this bitmap format, GEM IMG is sometimes also referred
to as GEM Bitmap or GEM Raster.


History
@line 1 60 0 0 7

GEM made its way into the market through OEM bundling deals, special
run-time versions bound to products, and as the native operating
environment of at least one system, the Atari ST computer family. GEM
image files were important in the PC desktop publishing community due
to the bundling deal between Digital Research and the creators of
Ventura Publisher, a widely used desktop publishing application.

The GEM IMG file format was designed to support raster images with a
varying @{"number of planes" LINK "Colour Depth"}. In the beginning, almost all IMG files
available were simple black and white single @{"plane" LINK "Colour Depth"} images because the
original file format did not specify a method of storing @{"palette" LINK "Colour Depth"}
information with the file. A second problem is that there is no way
of distinguishing between colour images and greyscale images.

To solve the omission of a @{"colour palette" LINK "Colour Depth"}, several unofficial
extensions to the format were put into use (some of which were
incorrectly implemented by applications supporting them).

However, one approach became popular, known as XIMG, for eXtended IMG
format. In 1990, this version had been published by the German Geiž
brothers in their legendary book 'Vom Anf„nger zum GEM-Profi' ('From
Beginner to GEM Professional'). Some years later, it became the de
facto standard for coloured GEM IMG files. In addition to storing the
@{"colour palette" LINK "Colour Depth"} in the file header, four different @{"colour" LINK "Colour Depth"}
@{"models" LINK "Colour Depth"}  are possible, namely @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"}, CMY, HLS and Pantone; but virtually
all XIMGs are @{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"} pictures.


True-Colour IMG Files
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Since this was not enough for some programmers, XIMG was extended by
the capability of saving @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} images. There were two
programmers at a time, who developed this extension, each without
knowing of the other, and so there are two incompatible @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"}
XIMG formats, the PixArt TC XIMG and the GEM-View TC XIMG.
Unfortunately, these varieties are not distinguishable for a program.

When everything calmed down a little, Guido Vollbeding released
suggestions for extension of the IMG compression routines in 1994 and
defined the TIMG format. However, only very few programs support
this format.

zView reads GEM-View TC XIMG files. They can be saved, for example,
with the picture viewers and converters Imagecopy (the option 'Word-
align @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} IMG' should be disabled) and, of course, GEM-
View, and the graphics applications PixArt (saved as '@{"RGB" LINK "Colour Depth"}') and
Smurf. Even @{"true-colour" LINK "Colour Depth"} IMG files created by the media player
Aniplayer can be viewed although they are not XIMGs.


File Extension
@line 1 60 0 0 7

GEM (X)IMG files are saved with the file extension *.img. However, so
are many other file formats, so you cannot assume that any file
ending *.img is one of these; it might not be a graphics file at all.
A fact that causes confusion in some applications designed to read
only GEM (X)IMG files.


Compression
@line 1 60 0 0 7

Actually, the original GEM IMG format is pretty simple. However, it
is not easy to read since four types of RLE compression algorithms
are applied to the pixel data of an image: Literal Run, Pattern Run,
Solid Run and Vertical Replication Count, depending on the sequence
of data values. Nevertheless, RLE compression is not efficient for
complex images.

In practice, some programs write IMG files that are not compressed,
and others create IMGs without compressing them properly. Imagecopy,
for example, can reduce IMG files considerably in size.

There are some CT60 with a 68060 without an FPU.
So, if you use your CT60 with a
- MC68LC060 (LC = no FPU),
- MC68EC060 (EC = no FPU and no PMMU), or
- MC68060 with 75 MHz (no LC letters, but it is one),
you cannot use zView!

There are some tools for sorting a directory. For example,
DirectorySort by Philipp Donz‚ for FAT and VFAT file systems
is to be recommended.
You do not need a tool for sorting a directory, though:
 - Create a new folder, for example, 'Tmp'.
 - Move the Auto folder files into the new folder.
 - Copy all programs back into the Auto folder that should
   be started before program X.
 - Copy program X back into the Auto folder.
 - Copy all programs back into the Auto folder that should
   be started after program X.
 - Delete the Tmp folder.

Design rule for Camera File system (DCF) is a
JEITA specification which defines a file
system for digital cameras, including the
directory structure, file naming method,
character set, file format and metadata
format. It is currently the de facto industry
standard for digital still cameras. The file
format of DCF conforms to the Exif
specification, but the DCF specification also
allows use of any other file formats.
